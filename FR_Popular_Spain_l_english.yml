### Events ###
socspain.0.t:0 "Revolution in Spain"
socspain.0.d:0 "Socialism established itself during the latter half of the 19th century, largely represented within the Spanish Socialist Worker's Party. Since then, there has always been a socialist presence in the country. Over time, more socialist movements were established on the edges of Spanish politics. \n\nAfter the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, socialists experienced sufficient growth in popularity in the new Second Republic. This shows that the people do not want a kingdom or a liberal republic. What they want is socialism! When the monarchists attempted to coup the government - the coup that would lead to the start of the civil war - socialists rallied to their own flag. \n\nThe civil war will be the beginning of the revolution that will bring Spain into socialism. Long Live Socialism! Long Live the Revolution!"
socspain.0.a:0 "No Pasarán!"

socspain.1.t:0 "Catalan Nationalist Protests"
socspain.1.d:0 "With our base of operation currently in Barcelona, it is no suprise that there will be some problems with the Catalans. While most of them are in favour of the revolution, there are those that does not agree with our goals. Catalan nationalism is clearly dangerous and needs to be stamped out."
socspain.1.a:0 "We Shall Show Them!"

socspain.2.t:0 "The International Brigades"
socspain.2.d:0 "The Thrid International has just recently set up the International Brigades, a paramilitary group of socialists from many different countries, who are now arriving in Spain to defend the Revolution. We owe them for their help against the monarchist reactionaries in this war."
socspain.2.a:0 "Workers of the World!"

socspain.3.t:0 "Madrid Under Our Control"
socspain.3.d:0 "Madrid, the capital of Spain, has fallen under our control. Having the Republican stonghold under our occupation is a massive victory, both in the civil war and in gaining legitimacy internationally."
socspain.3.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"

socspain.4.t:0 "Seville Under Our Control"
socspain.4.d:0 "We have managed to push south and capture the city of Seville. The city has worked as a base for the monarchist forces in Spain, where they have often received British support through Gibraltar. With this victory, the monarchist cause is close to total defeat."
socspain.4.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"

socspain.5.t:0 "Galicia Under Our Control"
socspain.5.d:0 "We have managed to push northwest and capture Galicia. The region has been a seat for the Nationalist uprising through the civil war. With this area under control, we can say to have been successful in securing the northern territories of Spain."
socspain.5.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"

socspain.6.t:0 "Fall of the Monarchists!"
socspain.6.d:0 "The Monarchists and the Nationalists have been defeated. We have managed to defeat the forces that have tried to reestablish the old and autocratic regimes. But while this is a victory for Spain, our country is still divided, now between Republicans and Socialists. Conflict will soon break out."
socspain.6.a:0 "At Least There are Two Less Foes"

socspain.7.t:0 "Catalanist Anti-Socialists at May-Day"
socspain.7.d:0 "May-day, the celebration for the workers and labourer, seems today to be couped and occupied by Catalanist anti-socialist forces. We need to show these regressive forces what happens to those threatning the workers of Spain."
socspain.7.a:0 "How Dare They!"

socspain.8.t:0 "Conflict With the Republicans!"
socspain.8.d:0 "The non-aggression agreement between us and the Republicans has been broken. News of clashes at the border has started a conflict once again. It is time to see if Spain will be a republicn regime or a socialist paradise."
socspain.8.a:0 "The War Continues"

socspain.9.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
socspain.9.d:0 "The Spanish civil war is over! After an eternity of fighting, the Socialists have come out on top. While our success is grand, there will be difficulties following this victory."

socspain.10.a:0 "This is What Capitalism Brings"

socspain.11.t:0 "Anti-Government Protests"
socspain.11.d:0 "Many people have started to blame the Socialist government for their misery in the aftermath of the London Crash. With war and unemployment, no one is happy that our government focusing too little on the civilians of Spain."
socspain.11.a:0 "War is War. When Peace Comes, it Will be Better"

socspain.12.t:0 "The London Stock Market Crash hits Spain"

socspain.12.a:0 "We Pray That This Will not Tear Down Spain"

socspain.13.t:0 "Growing Conflict in the Movement"
socspain.13.d:0 "Reports have arrived, informing us of rising violence between anarchists and communists in Spain. Disagreements have come up about how the country should be governed. The anarchists argue that the communists are just as worse as the monarchist reactionaries, while many communists sees the anarchists as traitors to socialism for their opposition to the Soviet Union. How are we going to act?"
socspain.13.a:0 "Side With the Communists Against the Anarchists!"

socspain.101.t:0 "Army Loyalty Reassured"
socspain.101.d:0 "Colonels in the army who have had a history of being even slightly anti-socialist have either been arrested, assassinated, or deported. The government believes that with this, the army's loyalty has been secured to protect Spain."
socspain.101.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"

socspain.102.t:0 "A Congress of the Revolutionaries"
socspain.102.d:0 "With stability beginning to return, the governing PCE has been pressured by the other factions in this revolution, the moderate socialist PSOE and the radical anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI, to set up a congress where all of the factions can be represented. While this might improve relations between the factions, what we fear with this new congress is that other factions will try to take away our power."
socspain.102.a:0 "We Will See What Happens"

socspain.103.t:0 "Reports of More Conflict in the Streets"
socspain.103.d:0 "Recently, there have been more and more reports of clashes between anarchists and communists out on the streets of Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities in the country. There might be a situation forming where such action can spread to the Congress if it is not taken care of; a situation that could very well destroy our vision for this country."
socspain.103.a:0 "Contact PSOE for Cooperation"
socspain.103.b:0 "Plan an Attack on the CNT-FAI"

socspain.104.t:0 "PSOE Agrees to Cooperate"
socspain.104.d:0 "After some hours in a secret meeting, the leaders of the moderate socialist PSOE have agreed to cooperate with the PCE government. While our cooperation can not be noticed by the anarcho-syndicalists, with time, we can secure a future and the revolution for Spain together."
socspain.104.a:0 "Happy to Come to an Agreement"

socspain.105.t:0 "The Anarcho-Syndicalist March"
socspain.105.d:0 "Today, many people, under the banner of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI, have started to march in the capital city of Madrid, protesting against the current system of governance and the ruling Communist Party. While most of them are unarmed, there are many that are armed. The police have said that this could be a perfect oppurtunity for us to launch our surprise attack."
socspain.105.a:0 "Crack Down on Them! Crush Their Counter-Revolutionary March!"
socspain.105.b:0 "Stand Ready to Arrest Those That Break the Law, Nothing More"

socspain.106.t:0 "PSOE Changes Sides"
socspain.106.d:0 "The socialist traitors in the PSOE have changed sides in this conflict, which have evolved between the PCE government and the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI. After the street massacre yesterday, we have begun to lose many allies and supporters. It is even rumored that part of the military will turn against us. This is indeed a blow to our legitimacy."
socspain.106.a:0 "How Dare They!"

socspain.107.t:0 "The Army Storms the Government Buildings"
socspain.107.d:0 "The army has joined the side of the socialist PSOE and the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI. Today, they entered the congress and arrested its PCE members. Following this, the government buildings were stormed, with many ministers being arrested. They have now reached the office of Chairman Ramos, with the intent of their action quite clear."
socspain.107.a:0 "'José Díaz Ramos! You are under Arrest!'"

socspain.108.t:0 "The Aftermath"
socspain.108.d:0 "With the PCE government in captivity, and the PSOE and CNT-FAI victorious, the congress is holding a vote on what path the country shall follow. It is likely that the remaining members of congress will be rather split on what group to support to govern the country. The Spanish Socialist Worker's Party are more moderate than the CNT-FAI, but also a little bit more authoritarian. On the other hand, the National Confederation of Labour and their allies in the Iberian Anarchist Federation are more radical than the PSOE, seeing both the authoritarian right and authoritarian left as enemies of the real revolution."
socspain.108.a:0 "The Congress Is in Favour of a PSOE Government!"
socspain.108.b:0 "The Congress Is in Favour of a CNT-FAI Government!"

socspain.109.t:0 "The Head of Our Government"
socspain.109.d:0 "With the socialist PSOE controlling the country, it is time to find out who will be the head of this new government. It could either be party leader Francisco Largo Caballero, or the moderate Juan Negrín y López."
socspain.109.a:0 "Party Leader Caballero"
socspain.109.b:0 "The Moderate Negrín"

socspain.110.t:0 "The Head of the CNT-FAI Congress"
socspain.110.d:0 "With the CNT-FAI controlling the country, it is time to pick who is going to be the head of the new CNT-FAI Congress. It seems like the choice will be between an Anarchist and a Syndicalist."
socspain.110.a:0 "The Anarchist Oliver"
socspain.110.b:0 "The Syndicalist Pestaña"

socspain.111.t:0 "CNT-FAI Militias Seize the March"
socspain.111.d:0 "While our men stood in formation at the march, ready to arrest those causing problems, more and more armed men began to turn up, some even carrying extra weapons, with the intent of giving them to the other anarcho-syndicalists. The police have now been forced to react against this threat to prevent it from developing into a massacre. We must show them that they have gone too far."
socspain.111.a:0 "Now they have gone too far!"

socspain.112.t:0 "Stability Returns Following Purges"
socspain.112.d:0 "With purges against the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI menance in the main cities of Spain, stability has begun to return. The police and many PCE loyal militia groups have reported that they have cracked open the hideouts of many anarcho-syndicalist militia groups, and given them the bullet. The revolution might be saved from those radicals in the CNT-FAI after all."
socspain.112.a:0 "This is a Good Development"

socspain.113.t:0 "PCE Strenghtens Control"
socspain.113.d:0 "With the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI menance taken care of, and the moderate socialist PSOE remaining silent, it seems that the government's grip upon Spain is strong. There are even people in the PSOE that have become convinced to switch over to our movement instead. Finally can we secure the socialist revolution within Spain!"
socspain.113.a:0 "Long Live Socialism! Long Live the Revolution!"

socspain.114.t:0 "A Plot Against the Anarcho-Syndicalists"
socspain.114.d:0 "After many hours in meetings between the government and the army, a plan has been put together with the strong potential to work. It will help us root out and execute the leaders of the anarcho-syndicalists with a military operation into the houses and streets. While this might not sit as well with the moderate socialist PSOE, we can inform them about it in advance, if we so choose."
socspain.114.a:0 "Enact It!"

socspain.115.t:0 "Violence Grips the Streets"
socspain.115.d:0 "Violence has begun to break out as soldiers enter houses and streets in the cities of Spain. After an episode where an anarcho-syndicalist attacked a police squadron with a knife, the police have begun to use more violent meassures when raiding houses and taking prisoners. The anarcho-syndicalist members in congress have been placed under house arrest, with some being vocally opposed to our police and military's violent measures."
socspain.115.a:0 "We Will Crush the Anarchist Scum!"

socspain.116.t:0 "The PSOE Opposition"
socspain.116.d:0 "With the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI in the dirt, there is now only one faction left that has a chance to oppose us; the moderate socialist PSOE."
socspain.116.a:0 "We Need to Remove All Counter-Revolutionaries"
socspain.116.b:0 "We Need to Restart our Relationship"

socspain.117.t:0 "The PSOE - CNT-FAI Alliance"
socspain.117.d:0 "An alliance has been made between the PSOE and the CNT-FAI. This might mean the fall of the PCE."
socspain.117.a:0 "This Might Mean Our Downfall"

socspain.118.t:0 "The PSOE - PCE Agreement"
socspain.118.d:0 "An agreement has been made between the PSOE and the PCE. Hopefully this will lead to the end of internal conflict."
socspain.118.a:0 "This Offer Will Lead to Victory"

socspain.119.t:0 "The Congress Moves to Elect a New Chairman"
socspain.119.d:0 "The Congress is now in the process of deciding who shall be the new Chairman of Spain, and the Successor to Spanish Socialism. This could take just days or a week, or it could last until the next year. \n\nThe current Chairman, José Díaz Ramos, has served more as an interim rather than a true Chairman. But he is one of those that has stepped forward to lead Spain into the future. Another candidate to become Chairman, or Chairwoman in this case, is Dolores Ibárruri, known as the Passionflower. She and Ramos hold many similar views, with both embracing Leninist Socialism. But there are those that would see a potential Chairwoman Ibárruri as a sign of gender equality in the country. \n\nThe young José Cazorla Maure is another who has stepped into the ring. He is one that was ruthless in weeding out sabotage or subversion, and he is generally disliked by Trotskyists and the Right-wingers. \n\nSpeaking of the right-wing of Socialism, there is a candidate from that wing in the form of Joaquín Maurín. It remains to be seen if he will be able to unite the party under his Right-wing agenda. \n\nThe last candidate is the Trotskyist Andrés Nin Pérez, who has even worked as secretary to Trotsky. He is looked down on by the Leninists and the National Collectivists, but perhaps he would be able to unite Spanish Socialism under his view."
socspain.119.a:0 "Let it Begin!"

socspain.120.t:0 "The Candidates Present Themselves"
socspain.120.d:0 "The candidates that have voiced their interest in trying to become the next Chairman came before the Congress today, expressing their views for the future. Ramos and Ibárruri focused on the dream of a Leninist Socialist nation. Maure advocated for a Socialist movement that is National and grants the country strength. Maurín expressed a vision for a Socialism with a new economic policy and marxist pluralism. Pérez spoke for a Permanent Revolution and supported proletarian Internationalism."
socspain.120.a:0 "Ramos' Ideas Found a Home in the Congress.."

socspain.120.f:0 "Nin Pérez Reminded Them That the Revolution is International"

socspain.121.t:0 "Our International Focus"
socspain.121.d:0 "One way to find out who is going to become chairman is for the Congress to hear the candidates' proposed views for the future. The candidates are today presenting their views for international and foreign politics."
socspain.121.a:0 "Ramos and Ibárruri Teamed up For Soviet Cooperation"
socspain.121.b:0 "Maure Wanted a Strong Nation to Protect the Revolution"

socspain.122.d:0 "Spanish society is flawed, with many views on how to best fix it.
