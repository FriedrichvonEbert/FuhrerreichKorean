SWI_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "스위스는 수 세기 넘게 그 누구와도 싸워본 적이 없습니다 - 나폴레옹 시대 전까진 말이죠. 지난 20년동안 계속되었던 자유주의 정당의 집권은, 1935년의 총파업과 함께 위협받았습니다. 스위스는 여전히 안정적이긴 하지만, 예전에 있었던 사회주의자들의 총파업과, 독일의 침공 위협 탓에, 스위스에겐 친구는 많지만, 동맹은 얼마 없습니다..."

#### Ideas ####

SWI_Vorarlberg:0 "The Status of Vorarlberg"
SWI_Vorarlberg_desc:0 "In 1919, the people of Vorarlberg, formally a region in Austria, voted overwelming to join Switzerland. However, this move has caused religious and enthic tension. The majority Protestant and Italian cantons were against the intergration of Vorarlberg. With the world seemingly erupting in tension again, the question has caught the public eye once again. What should be done with Vorarlberg?"
SWI_arms_industry:0 "스위스 군수 산업"
SWI_arms_industry_desc:0 "스위스는 뛰어난 군수공학자들로 유명했습니다. 위계적인 공장과 스위스 고유의 견습생 프로그램을 사용하여, 스위스는 공장-현장의 유기적 생산방식을 완벽하게 구현한것으로 보입니다."
SWI_die_schweizer_armee:0 "스위스군"
SWI_die_schweizer_armee_desc:0 "스위스의 대부분은 육군입니다. 18세 이상부터 자원입대가 가능하며 20세 이상부터는 의무적으로 복무하게 됩니다. 공격적으로 기동하는 병과는 없지만, 스위스군은 잘 무장되어있으며, 적절한 징병책을 사용하고 있습니다."
SWI_the_swiss_banking_act:0 "스위스 은행법"
SWI_the_swiss_banking_act_desc:0 "1933년 12월 1일에 서명된 은행법은 스위스내에서 계좌 보유자의 자산을 보호하기 위해 만들어진 법안으로 이는 프랑스가 라인란트 지역에 개입하면서 많은 외국 자산들과 회사들을 압류하거나 폐쇄하자 이에 대응하여 만들어진 법안이습니다. 은행법은 은행이 계좌 보유자의 이름을 밝히는 것을 범죄라고 규정했으며 프랑스와 독일 정부가 라인 지역의 산업단지와 관련이 있는 특정 계좌의 이름을 밝히라고 스위스 정부에 압박해올때 효과가 있는것으로 판명되었습니다."
SWI_swiss_neutrality:0 "영구중립"
SWI_swiss_neutrality_desc:0 "스위스는 나폴레옹 시대 이전까지 께지지 않은 해외의 전쟁에 참여하지 않다는 자랑스러운 전통을 가지고 있습니다. 제1차 대전쟁때 몇 차례 아슬아슬한 상황은 있었지만, 우리나라를 갈등으로 몰고 갈 만한 심각한 사건은 결코 없었다. 바라건대, 이러한 일들이 앞으로 계속 진행될 수 있기를 바랍니다."

SWI_arms_industry_taxing_weapons:0 "스위스 군수산업"
SWI_arms_industry_taxing_weapons_desc:0 "Switzerland is renowned for its excellent armsmiths and weapons crafters.

By taxing weapons from its manufactors, it can also benefit more weapons to its military."

### EVENTS ###
swi.99.d:0 "What are you doing? Have you really played this game so much that you have decided to play Switzerland? This nation has nothing to it, it's neutral and boring. Get a life."
swi.1.d:0 "For the past century, since the era of Napoleon, the Swiss nation has not engaged in a foreign war. While The Great War almost brought our nation to the brink of the maelstrom a couple of times, no threat was ever enough to ensure that we had no choice. Our country has continued to develop upward and onward- while the Swiss Banking Act gave small but continuous profit from one of our most influential trade sectors, some socialist agitation in the form of the SPdS led to one of the most devastating strikes in recent memory, which shut down many factories and rail systems. Negotiations were swift and bloodless, but the divide was no less felt. Through three successive elections, the Federal Council, has seen no change, and a joint Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei/Christlichdemokratische Volkpartei coalition rules this country. The liberal order remains strong, and our enemies are few! Even as we approach the next decade, we remain strong in Our Glorious Alps."

While many work sectors have implemented apprenticeship programs, apprenticeships in the arms industry have been targeted at younger gunsmiths as well, which, while boosting the arms industry, has a measurable amount of accidents and harm. What should we do about it?"

swi.20.d:0 "The Italians have denied us access to their ports, citing that we should stick to domestic companies to see their products to neighboring countries instead of trying to take advantage of state ports."

Even now, the leaders of several unions, have offered to purchase the copy from the government once the case has ended against the so-labeled 'revolutionaries'. What should our response be?"
swi.39.d:0 "Habsburg royalty from various coutries, including Italy, Hungary, and the United Kingdom have convened over the last week in celebration of a historic marriage that, in many ways, has shaken the historical European royal institution to its very core. A marriage between Wilhelm IV, the lead issue of the House of Hohenzollern, and Archduchess Rosa von Österreich, one of the the foremost duchesses of the House of Habsburg, were wed in Lucerne, Switzerland over the weekend. While both houses forbid, unofficially or officially, the marraige of legitimate offspring to unlanded suitors, this marriage occurred at the behest of both houses. While both spouses are de jure titled, neither's ancestral house holds sway in the homelands of their births. What this could represent if that were reversed, however, is monumental..."

Behind them are a spattering of ethnic nationalist parties and socialist-communists, though none of these parties are expected to get more than a couple seats each. The FDP, which has led the council in seats for the past three elections, may be challenged yet. The current council, which seats 4 members of the FDP, 2 members of the CDVP, and one member of the SDPS, has not changed since 1919, but this could easily change in the coming weeks..."

swi.103.d:0 "The SUP, who finally held a significant share of the vote and represented themselves as an alternative to the FDP's unchained liberalism and the SDPS's all-encompassing socialism, are demanding a seat on the council. Judging by their new political position in the Swiss political sphere, it seems necessary that the other parties oblige..."
swi.104.d:0 "The Coucil Membership, once worried to be entering a state of flux, did not receive any drastic changes in the recent election. While the FDP and CDVP gained a couple seats, no party is expected to get voted into the council. For all intents and purposes, the Council has reached status quo for the fourth consecutive election."
swi.106.d:0 "Rudolf Minger, the leader of the Christlichdemokratische Volkspartei, gave an interview in the press yesterday of his ambition to restore Switzerland to its 'agrarian roots'. This supposed arrangement goes against the FDP-CDVP coalition line that claims to service all citizens of Switzerland, from the farms to the urban centers and other developed regions. The move, to say the least, was considered very politically unshrewd."
swi.107.d:0 "The FDP's vote in the Council, which attempted to ameliorate hostilities with socialist factions in Switzerland through negotiation, met yesterday. Talks are ongoing, but warmer than expected..."
swi.108.d:0 "Polls within the Federal Council and National Council indicate that a shift toward the CDVP's politics has become apparent. Several members of the FDP have stepped down from political positions following the violent response to the strikes and wider socialist movement within Switzerland. While several conservative members are attempting to stop a possible path towards tyranny, several radical members of the CDVP are attempting to make themselves known, and make themselves heard."
swi.109.d:0 "Negotiations with the socialist striker groups has paid off! Although we had to make some concessions, we avoided a widescale catastrophe like 1935. The strikers are generally back to work, and the workplaces that were once shut down for days are running again."
swi.110.d:0 "The CDVP has lodged a threat to usurp the coalition in the National Council! From this point on, the coalition in its current form can be considered dissolved, and talks are already underway between the SDPS and the FDP, but after the recent strikes, most political commentators are saying that that is far from the possible. At this moment, the CDVP seems to control the political landscape of Switzerland."
swi.111.d:0 "Jean Debet, a political newcomer from the Geneva canton, gave an impassioned speech to the National Council today denouncing the capitulation of the Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei to the socialist protestors. Himself considered a radical amongst fellow party members, he was swiftly denounced by other fellow moderates. The coalition holds, at least for now."
swi.112.d:0 "Albert Meyer, leader of the FDP, tendered his resignation today from Swiss politics. Considered a tentpole and mainstay of the party for the past decade, his resignation came as combined shock and expectation, depending on one's political outlook. Another blow to a party staggering from a dangerous strike."

swi.116.d:0 "The CDVP has won the deliberation vote in the Council on a response to the union strikes after convincing FDP member Johannes Baumann. The result is a harsh sentence for violent strikers- now in the press the FDP, which only a couple years ago was considered to be politically cooperative with the CDVP is reconsidering such a position."
swi.117.d:0 "Yesterday, Robert Tobler, one of the leading figures of the CDVP, was elected to the Federal Council, and has today been elected as President of Switzerland. While the position doesn't itself carry many additional privileges, it was used as a pretext by Tobler to dissolve the oligarchic nature of the cabinet. The CDVP-FDP coalition in the National Council agreed to the conditions to the immense disagreement of the SDPS, the SUP, and surprisingly every ethnic nationalist party holding seats in the National Council. Regardless, in a move Tobler declared to be a 'striking blow to socialist terrorists from Geneva to Bregenz', the Federal Council now acts more like a cabinet than an organ of state, and all duties have essentially been handed to those of his choosing, though the member of the SDPS has kept his position, at least for now."
