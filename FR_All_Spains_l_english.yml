#Events
scw.1.t:0 "The Republic Destroyed"
scw.1.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War has swung against our favor, with the Spanish Republic, which controlled Madrid, falling not long ago. The rebel movements have begun to move into Tangiers, but our very close proximity to it can cut off the rebel forces, and allow us to start a Republican government in exile there. Doing so will hurt relations with the victor of the war, but will allow us to maintain a claim on the region."

scw.2.t:0 "The Civil War Ends"
scw.2.d:0 "When the dust settled, we came out on top, the one and only Republican government. We are left with a broken nation, people, and industry, and the recovery process will be one of the most difficult the nation has ever seen. But today, Spain can together say that it was won."

scw.3.t:0 "The Civil War Ends"
scw.3.d:0 "When the dust settled, we came out on top, the one and only Nationalist government. We are left with a broken nation, people, and industry, and the recovery process will be one of the most difficult the nation has ever seen. But today, Spain can together say that it was won."

scw.4.t:0 "The Civil War Ends"
scw.4.d:0 "When the dust settled, we came out on top, the one and only People's government. We are left with a broken nation, people, and industry, and the recovery process will be one of the most difficult the nation has ever seen. But today, Spain can together say that it was won."

scw.5.t:0 "The Civil War Ends"
scw.5.d:0 "When the dust settled, we came out on top, the one and only Monarchist government. We are left with a broken nation, people, and industry, and the recovery process will be one of the most difficult the nation has ever seen. But today, Spain can together say that it was won."

scw.6.t:0 "The London Stock Market Crash"
scw.6.d:0 "With our main and only source of income being the United Kingdom, their recent economic depression has cut off their support worse than their cutoff during the Indian Revolt. Our already-broken economy has been declared dead by many economists, and support for war overall within the country is at an all-time low. Many within our land are telling us to surrender, and for the 'Kingdom to be buried once and for all!'."
scw.6.a:0 "This is truly the end..."
