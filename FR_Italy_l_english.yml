ITA_FUHRERREICH_DESC: "이탈리아는 대전쟁 이후 두배의 가까운 새로운 영토와 고토를 수복함으로써 신흥국가로써 부상했습니다. 그러나 그 이후의 상황은 좋지 않았습니다, 전쟁은 우리의 경제에 타격을 주었고 혼란속에서 노동자들은 파업을 했습니다. 혼란은 1923년 시인 단눈지오가 쿠데타를 실패할때까지 유지되었습니다, 이러한 사건들후에 정부는 긴축되었으며 왕은 퇴위하였습니다. 오늘날 이탈리아는 거의 안정되었지만 세계에 영향을 미치는 바람이 언제 들이닥칠지 모릅니다...."

ita.0.d:0 "In 1914 as Europe was finding itself embroiled in the first major war of the 20th century Italy remained neutral, at least initially. The Pact of London promised Italy land in the Balkans in exchange for military support against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. With this agreement Italy had joined Entente Cordiale dragging her people into war that many were sure would be over by Christmas. Despite seemingly being on the edge of collapse after several recent defeats Austria-Hungary put up a formidable defense against the Italians. The Italian front collapsed into the same stalemate as seen in France. It took the Entente until 1919 to defeat the Central Powers but even as a victor Italy was not unscathed. \n\nSocial strife that had been building in Italy for years exploded as soldiers returning from the front were welcomed back to a home that could not provide for them. As Italy's economy crashed the Socialists, emboldened by the Russian Revolution, occupied the factories and fought to police, an era now known as the 'Red Biennium'. In response the Nationalists formed their own 'Squadre d'Aziones' as a paramilitary force to deal with this threat. As the prospect of civil war grew on the horizon the time for compromise and reform was needed more than ever. The once united Socialist party was divided on how to proceed in their goal to liberate the workers leading to Amedeo Bordiga and Antonio Gramsci to break off and form the Communist Party of Italy. The left wing of Italy never recovered from this division allowing the recently formed Italian People's Party lead by the clerical socialist Luigi Sturzo to make compromises with the more moderate Italian Socialist party. Several reforms supported by both parties expanded the rights of the workers within Italy including the right to vote for all Italian adults as well as legal protections for Italy's new minorities gained as a result of the Great War. \n\nWhile this era of compromise brought stability and economic growth to Italy through the 20's it's positive effect have begun to vanish. The PPI's 'Big tent' political stance no longer appeals to the party's demographic. Sturzo's left leaning politics have increasingly put him at odds with the party's catholic faction lead by the conservative Alcide De Gasperi. As the politics within Italy grow increasingly radical the PPI must adapt to the changing times or be lost to history."

Palmiro Togliatti of the Communist Party alternatively stated that the Italian nation should leave the reactionary Entente and instead should align itself with the Soviet Union however his statement was not supported by the more moderate Socialists. The Liberals insisted that Italy should realign herself with Britain whose economy Italy is dependent on.

Most of the democratic socialists wish to pursue a broader goal of decentralization for the regions of Italy. The Communist suggested to create Anti-Mafia militias squad to protect the people.

In Africa the French have done their best to prevent Italian influence from growing, such as forcing the assimilation of Italian settlers in Tunisia who even to this day still out number French settlers in the region.

In the past this offer would have been quickly ignored but with the recent economic downturn it may be in our best interests to consider it. While in the age of sail having Malta as a naval base was a sensible decision, the invention of aircraft such as naval bombers puts any ship stationed at the island in a vulnerable position. The Italians and French both have large air basses well in range of Malta. Few in Britain see value in defending Malta when the larger and much more secure base in Alexandria can be used.

In the event that The United Kingdom is no longer able to protect the security of it's empire, the Italians want our blessing to secure Gibraltar and Suez for the purpose of guarantying naval access to Mediterranean. In Britain the vague wording of the Italian document has some ministers concerned about it's hypothetical enforcement but advocates for it see this agreement with Italy as a solid first step towards rapprochement.

While many great empires have attempted this in the past, the task was seemingly too much for the Franco-Italian alliance. Rome now seeks an alliance with us. An Anglo-Italian alliance would be a major shake up to the balance of power. Our combined navies would easily overwhelm France or Germany plus our two nation's location within Europe would force either of those powers into a two front war if needed.

In a compromise between the two sides Serbia was granted these former Austrian lands but could not form a de jure Pan-Slavic state. This decision though did little to appease either side as it did not do much to address conflicting land claims. Today though Rome has denounced [GetName.SER] as a authoritarian back water that cares little of it's ethnic minorities.

Italy's desperation to become the dominating power within the Mediterranean had put her at odds with France in the past but many had hoped that their alliance would put an end to these squabbles but it seems the ambition of a growing Empire can never truly go away. Italy has now chosen to seek their own destiny separate from France. This development has put the fate of the Entente in question.

The French occupation of this region has been a sore spot in Franco-German relations and [GER.GetLeader] has made no secret of his desire to reclaim it. The Rhine river offers much protection but it is by no means uncrossable. Austria is also a region of German ambition. If they were to annex this region it would be a seriously blow to Italian security. We must not allow the Germans to flank our armies through the Alps.

The spirit of the Duke of Victory Armando Diaz, whom passed away in 1928, is still living strong in the army and thanks to him Italian soldiers are no longer under equipped but this has also lead to complacency within the commanding officers which may weaken are ability to defend ourselves. Earlier attempts at modernization began when Italy started purchasing tanks from Britain in 1928 which has helped the Italian war industry advance quite significantly. FIAT is pushing for the implementation of newer, home built, tanks into the army so we can spare our soldiers the unprotected slaughter they were subjected to in the Great War but some officers believe that the one major reason for the Italian army's poor performance in that war was due to the lack of sufficient artillery. Instead of focusing on expensive and vulnerable tanks they think we should make sure our soldiers have advanced and powerful artillery to support their attacks. In Rome, collectivist politicians have influenced some army leaders to integrate the paramilitary/partisan Red Brigades into the army and push for the implementation of mass conscription and partisan warfare while the more conservative elements of parliament wish to give more autonomy to officers and generals who wish to create a strong, well trained and well equipped professional army spearheaded by powerful “Alpini” mountaineer divisions who are a great source of pride for the Italian Nation."

For decades he taught at both the University of Bologna and University of Rome La Sapienza where his dedication to his field help popularize and develop anthropology into the modern science we know today. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in his works especially on the 'Mediterranean race'. As the German Reich continues to push propaganda on the superiority of the Nordic people many Italian nationalists have countered with their own theories of a unified Mediterranean race which can trace it's origins back to Rome, Europe's first great civilization. The far right Fasci Italiani del Sindacalismo Nazionale (FISN) party sees Sergi's writings as a cornerstone of their movement. As the Nordic nations of Britain and Germany continue to spread their influence into the Mediterranean the FISN will continue to promote their ideals of a united state in southern Europe built on the legacy of Rome that can combat these foreign invaders. Whether he is remembered as a nationalist hero or a promoter of the sciences, Giuseppe Sergi will go down as one Italy's most significant intellectuals."

As the leader of the ruling FISN party and the National Syndicalist movement as a whole his death has sent a shock wave throughout Italy and the greater European community. His leadership and powerful oratory skills were paramount in bringing the FISN to power and revolutionizing Italian society. Preparations are being made for his funeral in which his coffin will be wrapped in flag of the Timavo and buried in the impressive mausoleum of the Vittoriale, a fitting resting place for such a national hero.\n\nDespite the national mourning we must continue to look towards the future of the party. Both houses of parliament have convened for an emergency meeting of the Arengo del Italia to decide on whom will succeed D'Annunzio as Comandante of Italy. As important as D'Annunzio has been for the party his leadership was far from perfect. He was never interested in the minute details of running a party let alone an entire nation state, choosing instead to focus on his writing and philosophy. This has forced many within the upper echelon of FISN to handle the duties usually expected of a Head of State. Though it isn't publicly known many of his close associates suspect that D'Annunzio's drug habit may have been exacerbated by the stress of his new position and may be responsible for his sudden death.\n\nWith D'Annunzio's death a power vacuum has opened within Italy that many within the FISN are desperately trying to fill. It will be some time before a new Comandante who can truly succeed D'Annunzio will be found. In the mean time we must remember this Italian hero and all the good that National Syndicalism has brought to Italy."

Three possible candidates have been found that are believed to be qualified enough to fill D'Annunzio's shoes.\n\nAlceste De Ambris, revolutionary syndicalist and coauthor of the Charter of Carnaro, is an obvious candidate for Comandante. Second only to D'annunzio himself, Ambris' political theories are a cornerstone of the National Syndicalist movement. Despite this many of his opponents are critical of his socialist past and his suspected relations with the USSR.\n\nEdmondo Rossoni, Secretary of The Confederation of Fascist Syndicates, is another possible candidate. A staunch ally of labor he is beloved by most of the working class as well as Italy's trade unions. He is a powerful and ambitious man with many grand plans for Italy but his hostility towards industrialists and other members of Italy's upper classes has lead to him being labeled as a \"Radical\" by some of the FISN more conservative elements who wish to see class cooperation.\n\nTullio Cianetti, radical trade unionist, has been selected as the final candidate. Despite his young age compared to most of the FISN leadership his reformist minded politics may bring new life to the party. He is already seen as a trusted ally of Italian labor but unlike Rossoni he shows no hostilities towards Italy's upper classes. His opponents though are concerned about his connections to Germany, specifically his friendship with Otto Strasser who's economic theories are seen with much skepticism back in Italy."

### Generals ###
ITA_Rodolfo_Graziani_desc:0 "§GMilitary Dossier\n§GBorn:§W11 August 1882 Filettino, Italy\n§GMilitary Career:§WGraziani joined the Regio Esercito (Royal Army) in 1903 and was soon stationed in Italian Eritrea. His first taste of success came during the Italo-Turkish war where he was promoted to Captain. He would continue to command forces during the Great War where his efforts would lead him to become the youngest Colonel in the Italian Army. Following Italy's victory against the Central Powers in 1919 Graziani became very influential on the affairs of Italy's newly gained possessions. He became infamous for his willingness to use any means necessary to assert Italian dominance over the local populations. With help from the local Greeks and in Panfilia, Graziani lead a brutal suppression of Turks in the region accused of supporting the Turkish National Movement. In Italian Cameroon he defeated a short lived guerrilla movement, forcing much of the civilian population into concentration camps and burning down thousands of square miles of jungle in the process. In Italy he is seen by many as a great Pacifier but those who have been the target of his wrath call him a butcher. Graziani is deeply conservative and believes that strong and iron fisted authority is needed to solve Italy's internal problems.\n§GNotes:§W\n-Tyrannical Authoritarian\n-Unprepared for another 'Great War'\n-Politically ambitious"

### Events ###
alb.1.t:0 "The National Liberation Movement finds more rural support"
alb.1.d:0 "Despite our police force's best efforts to keep order many of our citizens in rural regions have sympathies towards the NLM cause. It's is feared that many villages in the Korab mountains may even be harboring NLM personal, giving them the food and equipment needed to harass our army. Very little has been invested into properly dealing with this crisis which will only exacerbate the issue as time progresses."
alb.1.a:0 "We must increase police presense in the Korab mountains"
alb.4.t:0 "Liberation Day parade"
alb.4.d:0 "Though originally neutral in the Great War, Albania was drawn into the conflict when Austria invaded in a so called 'Friendly Occupation'. This was soon followed by a joint French-Italo intervention into southern Albania. The war in Albania lasted until spring of 1919 when the Entente powers were able to force Austria-Hungary to retreat from Albania. The Liberation of Albania has been celebrated as a national holiday ever since the end of the Great War as a way to pay respect to the Albanian and Italian forces who's sacrifice and bravery made it possible. The annual military parade that marches through Tirana for this occasion has, in recent years, become a target of Albanian dissidents. Riots, looting and other acts of violence have become common around the parade and the local police suspect that this year will see a large Socialist presence in the area. Ferdinand has made it a tradition to lead this parade but the increase in violence has some ministers concerned over his safty. They reccomend that Ferdinand stays at his residence this year to guarantee his safty but this may lead to further loss of legitimacy for our government."

alb.5.t:0 "Liberation Day bombing, The Prince is dead"
alb.5.d:0 "Despite warnings from his security advisors the Prince Ferdinand still chose to attend this years Liberation Day parade. Despite their best efforts the security at the event were unable to stop the terror bombing that ultimatly killed the prince. The explosion caused significant damage and lead to mass panic around the streets of Tirana. It took hours to find and identify the Prince's corpse and many more to capture the terrorist responisble, a member of the National Liberation Movement. The Prince's passing has been a massive shock to the people of Albania and Italy and sits as a reminder of how divided our nation still is."
alb.5.a:0 "This has gone too far. Petition Rome for more support."
alb.6.t:0 "Liberation Day bombing"
alb.6.d:0 "Despite their best efforts the security at the event were unable to stop the terror bombing that rocked Tirana today. The explosion caused significant damage and lead to mass panic around the streets of the city. It took hours for the panic to calm and many more to capture the terrorist responisble, a member of the National Liberation Movement. This terrorist attack has been a massive shock to the people of Albania and Italy and sits as a reminder of how divided our nation still is."
alb.6.a:0 "This has gone too far. Petition Rome for more support."
alb.7.t:0 "Albania pleades for support"
alb.7.d:0 "A recent terror attack in Tirana has shown that Albanian security forces are too weak and unorginzed addequetly defend their nation. Today the Albanian ambassader in Rome petitions us to send more forces to help stabilize the country. The crisis in Albania only serves to weaken our position in the Adriatic but many ministers warn that the cost of futher intervention in Albania may out weigh any possible benefit. They insist that as long a the port city of Vlore is secure our position in the Third Shore will be as well."
alb.7.a:0 "We must send troops to help stabilize the situation."
alb.7.b:0 "We are not in a position to send anything."

alb.8.a:0 "We can always count on Rome."
alb.9.t:0 "Italy refuses to send additional support"
alb.9.d:0 "Despite our desperation Rome has refused to send anymore troops to our nation. This leaves our own security forces to face growing opposition on it's own."

alb.10.t:0 "Midhat Frashëri demands the government to support the Balli Kombetar"
alb.10.d:0 "Midhat Frashëri, leader of the nationalist Balli Kombetar movement, has come to us to sign an agreement. For years the Balli Kombetar have fought Italian influence in Albania, attacking Italian settlements and buisnesses in our country but now they come to us on peaceful terms to make an offer. The only threat Frashëri despises more than Italy is socialsim. He has offered the services of the Balli Kombetar militia to help defend Albania from anymore Socialist encroachment. While this will help not only bolster our armed forces but will also give us more legitimacy to the average Albanian. Despite the optimism from many in our government, some warn of the possible threat of allowing such a violent faction to gain power in our government."
alb.10.a:0 "We must become a unified front to counter the Socialist rebels."

alb.14.t:0 "Remnants of the defeated Albanian NLM flee across our southern border"
alb.14.d:0 "For years the socialist Albanian National Liberation Movement has been fighting a guerrilla campaign to liberate Albania from Italian rule.

alb.15.t:0 "Battle of Tirana"
alb.15.d:0 "The National Liberation Movement, emboldened by our governments failiures to crush them, have launched a full scale assault on our capital city Tirana.

alb.18.d:0 "Albania has been plagued by instability for years. The socialist National Liberation Movement has been in a guerrilla war with our ally in Tirana and despite our support of their regime they have fallen to NLM. With most of Albania under NLM control it is only a matter of time before our key port at Vlore is attacked and with it our access to the Adriatic.
