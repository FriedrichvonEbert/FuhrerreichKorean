arg.1.t:0 "Argentina in 1936"
arg.1.d:0 "For decades, our nation has been ruled by the democratic dominance of the Unión Cívica Radical, or UCR, a social and liberal minded political party, whose dominance has caused great controversy in our society. It was to be expected groups with their own interests would use this political situation for their advantage.\n\nIn 1934, after the UCR's close victory against a coalition of opposition parties, Enrique Martínez assumed the charge of president. As Bolivia poised for victory in their conflict with Paraguay, Manuel Domecq, the war minister, and a prominent founding member of the nationalist group known as the Liga Patriótica Argentina, or LPA, used his influence in the recently elected president Martínez, who seeking further approval, declared war on Bolivia, on the charges of "maintaining order in the region". Domecq and the LPA sought to establish Argentinian hegemony in the region, while the UCR just wanted to increase their approval in a increasingly divided society. Nonetheless, the whole country united in support of the war effort.\n\nIt was a disaster, low in morale due to the poorly justified conflict, and just generally unprepared, the Argentinian military suffered elevated losses. While conscription allowed many of these to not alter the war effort, it altered our society. When Brazil saw the opportunity and demanded the war ended, and to return peace to the region, the government just accepted. Internally, the pressure of the anti-war collectivist and unionist movements was too strong, and threats of revolt remained in the government's mind.\nNow, the country is more divided politically than ever, as the memories of the war shape our politics and general discontent remains, almost nothing was won, yet we lost so much for it.\n\nAt least the economy's been doing good."

A black sunrise for our nation."
arg.2.a:0 "Well, crap."
arg.3.t:0 "Major protests begin amidst crisis"
arg.3.d:0 "It seems the political tension has returned to Argentina, as the newly unemployed, the hungry and the angry take it to the streets in protest to our government.\n\nWhatever we do, we must remain calm, and act wisely, as to be able to return Argentina to its feet once again, without causing something we will regret, and, considering the recent surge of Collectivist activity and the return of the patriotic leagues, that may be hard."
arg.3.a:0 "We can try."
arg.4.t:0 "Ligas attack protesters"
arg.4.d:0 "As we have awaited for the popular discontent to decrease, and the situation to cool down, not everyone has been so patient. Members of the paramilitary patriotic leagues have taken it to themselves in dealing with the protesters, accusing them of being misled by marxist influence, and shooting out to the memories of the Patagonia Rebeled, and as such there have been cases of open aggresion against these protesters.\n\nWhile certainly a dissuasive force that is useful to a certain degree, can we really stand these groups attacking common people?"

While we must be careful of who we are dealing with.\n\nOn the other hand, the LPA members in our government have repeatedly asked us to not accept any demands, as they believe negotiating with marxists may destroy our nation."

Buenos Aires turned red as the collectivists, as well as other revolutionary socialists, take over, and the republic of old is gone.\n\nA new Argentina has risen from its ashes, one made for and by the workers! The revolutionaries cheer as the new chairman Ghioldi announces the founding of the Collective of Argentina, the new workers' state that will bring socialist prosperity and brings us out of the crisis!"

arg.51.a:0 "The revolution arrives in Argentina."
arg.51.b:0 "The government struggles but the republic survives."
arg.52.d:0 "As we have handled the protests, the tension is still too much. People are unhappy and our government can't survive as it is. However, a chance has arrived.\n\nThe LPA, leading the fight against the protests, has helped us so far. While widely considered too extreme to lead a government, Admiral Domecq has offered us a pact. The LPA will gain greater influence in the government, but it seems only this way will the republic survive. Together, we are strong, and we will come out of this."
arg.52.t:0 "Survival at a price"
arg.52.a:0 "Finally, a patriotic government to lead us."
arg.53.t:0 "Violence increases as crisis escalates"
arg.53.d:0 "As the protesters turn into revolutionaries, and the violence increase, the patriotic leagues begin fighting off the revolutionaries. While they might not be able to hold them off for long, if we as government decide to give the LPA our support, combined we might we able to turn the tide and save the republic. Otherwise, the streets of Buenos Aires will turn red with the revolutionary tide."
arg.53.a:0 "Together, the LPA-UCR pact will save the republic."
arg.53.b:0 "The revolution succeeds as the old government collapses."
arg.10.t:0 "Government deals with the Labourers"
arg.10.d:0 "The weeks of labourers protesting over additional rights have come to an end, as our government officially announces the negotiations have finished and the workers go back to their regular work.\n\nWhile issues like this are to be expected, right-wing affiliated government officers have expressed their discontent in the goverment bending to the protesters' demands, while the government is clear it means to do whatever is necessary to solve any issues in a peaceful way."
arg.10.a:0 "It's nice for the workers to demand and get their needs."
arg.10.b:0 "Those who oppose order should be dispatched with force."
arg.11.t:0 "LPA factionalism as plurality is called for."
arg.11.d:0 "As the government called for plurality in reaction to the current climate critizising their democratic dominion of the electoral system, certain politicians affiliated to the LPA have tried to form a faction in our legislation, although the movement is not an official political party.\n\nThey argue it is in their free right, as well as several prominent LPA members of the government have declared their support in doing so, however, others have shown great discontent in this and it would surely enrage the chamber if we allowed this."
arg.11.a:0 "They are in their right to freely associate."
arg.11.b:0 "The LPA is not an official political party."
arg.12.t:0 "Collectivists politicize memorial"
arg.12.d:0 "As a memorial to those lost in the last war is unveiled by the government, Collectivist groups have taken it to demonstrate nearby, blaming the government for the mistakes of the war and pushing their own platform\n\n While most consider this display distasteful, it is hard to argue that the intervention in the war came out of the blue for most, and maybe a different government would have meant avoiding such losses."
arg.12.a:0 "We won't tolerate those disrespecting as we honour our fallen."
arg.12.b:0 "The radicals are blind to the blood on their hands."
arg.13.t:0 "Dialogue between government and opposition"
arg.13.d:0 "As the situation of our country has been carefully handled, today the government established friendly dialogue with the opposition, and seems to be at peace with dissidents in their won party, as well as with groups of differing ideology, wishing the best for Argentina bringing them all together."
arg.13.a:0 "It seems things are going our way."
arg.14.t:0 "The Revolution Arrives to Argentina"
arg.14.d:0 "As the workers' protests increased and social agitation grew, it reached the point where the government couldn't do anything, as it was in disarray.\n\nIt was from this chaos that the revolutionary workers mobilized and toppled the government, as the streets of cities all over Argentina turned red under the socialist flag. Now the old regime is gone, and the revolution rules Argentina. The ideologues of the Collectivist party, lead by Rodolfo Ghioldi, taking the lead in the insurrection and in this new revolutionary order."
arg.14.a:0 "The proletariat will be victorious."
arg.15.t:0 "Agitation as state nationalizes Industry"
arg.15.d:0 "As part of the wide reforms imposed by our socialist government, the nationalization of industry under the workers' control has been essential. This maneuver, however, has proved unpopular with many small and medium sized enterprises, who are agitating and producing chaos in our society. Reactionaries truly are found deep in our society."
arg.15.a:0 "We don't have time for this."
arg.16.t:0 "Reactionaries flee as government centralizes"
arg.16.d:0 "As our revolutionary government has began further centralizing its control over society, the reactionaries that still hold dear to their "democratic" traditions have decided to cross the border into neighbours countries where they can escape the revolution.\n\n It may be a good idea to limit this population flow, and do as we can to strengthen argentinian society, even if it would ease the tensions of our society to let them go."
arg.16.a:0 "Let them go."
arg.16.b:0 "Stop them."
arg.17.t:0 "The Red Sunrise"
arg.17.d:0 "On this day, we are commemorating all what we have gone through since the revolution began, as the new system is firmly settled, and the issues of the past are left behind, we can now look in pride as Argentina stands as a bastion for the workers, of revolution, in South America."
arg.17.a:0 "The Sun has risen for the workers."


arg.20.t:0 "The Confederation stands together"
arg.20.d:0 "As massive revolts wrapped our country, and the political crisis struck after the economic one arrived, the loyalists to the republic, no matter their ideology, stuck together and kept the government amidst the chaos.\n\n However, our government is currently extremely weakened in power and support by these events, and revolutionaries as well as other dissidents are strong in here. While we can try to carefully work through these issues alone, an offer has come to our attention, Admiral Domecq García, our war minister and elevated member of the LPA, says if we agree to give the LPA a greater influence in the government and legislation, they will give our government their backing and will make sure our regime is stable enough to advance through the chaos. We have to be wary, though."
arg.20.a:0 "The UCR will stand alone fixing our issues."
arg.20.b:0 "A pact with the LPA is necessary."
arg.21.t:0 "Opposition dissents to subsidization measures"

arg.22.d:0 "As a government we have always cared for the Argentinian youth to get the best education it can, but not everyone agrees with our means. Recently, after the plans for the announced reforms were published, socialists have taken to protest at these reforms, stating that the new plans are biased and non-neutral politically.

This decision, more than economical, will strengthen diplomatic ties between our countries.\nA popular yet controversial option is Germany. Their aggressive government makes good weapons, and their self sustaining economical model is of good example to us.\nAn interesting alternative, the French and our people hold no grudges, and may be a conservative pick.\nWhile trading with the US seems like a risky business but may lead to good things.

However, a token of peace, say, the northern province of Tarija, which used to belong to Bolivia, and is still a zone of tension, may be the key to friendly relationships.

While the Collectivists lament this division, the Anarchists in the Collective have shown optimism at this new development, a divided collectivist party allowing them a better chance at representation of their own ideas in the upcoming Congress next year."

A prominent diplomat, he stands for Partido Demócrata Nacional, and, is widely considered one of the leading men in bringing fresh air to Argentinian politics, although many consider he won't be that different from our previous governments.\n\nThe UCR's candidate, Vicente Gallo, has been a stauch defender of antipersonalist, and seeks to rather than get the UCR out of power, bring change to it internally, leading as a member of a different branch of the UCR we are accustomed to seeing.\n\nFinally, the most different candidate perhaps, is Alfredo Palacios. Popular with unionists and the lower classes, and leader of the Socialist Party, he wants to bring his socialists ideas to Argentina, not through revolution, but through democratic means."

Nonetheless the main factions that have formed are clear.\n\nThe Orthodox Collectivists, directly representing the government that took control during the Revolution and lead us to break our chains, they are lead by current chairman Rodolfo Ghioldi, and want to maintain the current direction our socialist society is developing in.\n\nA extreme faction that split off not long ago, characterized by their revisionist, unorthodox ideas, are the Vanguard Federal People's Party, lead by vanguardist Fanny Jacobsky, proposing a state-centric, rather authoritarian, and diplomatically expansionist doctrine. Many consider them to be a dangerous faction, for either us or our enemies.\n\nFinally, the unionists and anarchists have formed a rather large faction under the FACA, titularly lead by José Grunfeld, representing the interests of those that want a more local minded and autonomous, libertarian kind of socialism."

arg.305.a:0 "Damn it!"
arg.306.t:0 "Evidence of Vanguardist involvement"
arg.306.d:0 "A vocal opponent of the vanguardists, it comes to no surprise as we have found evidence of vanguardist involvement in the murder of Penelón. It seems the faction has tried to subvert our order and increase their influence in the congress, eliminating their rivals. While dangerous, a potential action to arrest the conspirators may damage the Vanguardists and bring further order to us, but is dangerous and costly."

No one is allowed to go out to the streets today.\n\nThe loyal citizens respected our order. Those who didn't were disposed of quickly. Our forces stormed the headquarters of the Collectivist-Anarchist coalition, and captured their leadership. Officially, now all political parties except the Vanguard Federal People's Party are banned. Those who dissent are criminals.
