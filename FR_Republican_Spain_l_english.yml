### Events ###
repspain.0.t:0 "The Republic of Spain"
repspain.0.d:0 "Republicanism in Spain is not something new on our peninsula. The first attempt at a Spanish Republic was in 1873, following the abdication of King Amadeo I. While the first republic only lasted for just over a year, with it being opposed by both Monarchists and Nationalists alike, the fact that it existed at all says something. It would become something to strive towards for us republicans. \n\nA new Spanish Republic would not arrive on the peninsula until the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera was over. This dictatorship was one that our King let happen in Spain, a sin we could not allow. In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was established, nearly 60 years after the first. At first, the republic faced many coup attempts, and not everyone was ready to accept its rule. It would culminate in the Christmas season of 1935, when a coup would be the final spark to light the fire of civil war. Monarchists and Nationalists have taken up arms against our government, after biding their time in the shadows. \n\nNow, the Spanish Republic is surrounded by the traitorous Monarchists and Nationalists, with the Socialists breaking free as well. This civil war will cost many lives, but it will be the test to see if the Republic is going to survive, or if its destiny will be the same as the first Republic's."
repspain.0.a:0 "Plus Ultra!"

repspain.1.t:0 "Protests in Rif"
repspain.1.d:0 "It will soon have been 10 years since the end of the Rif war. Again, there seems to be increasing trouble in the area. The Rifian people have seen our power and influence over Spanish Morocco weaken, and they have seen their chance to oppose our rule. While no all-out rebellion has taken place yet, this is concerning."
repspain.1.a:0 "Seems to Always be Some Problems Down There"

repspain.2.t:0 "Volunteers Arrive in Madrid"
repspain.2.d:0 "Pro-democratic volunteers have managed to enter our territory through our borders with Portugal and the Socialists. These are young men and women who do not want to see another European country fall to autocratic monarchies or a socialist regime."

repspain.3.t:0 "Seville Under Our Control"
repspain.3.d:0 "We have managed to push south and capture the city of Seville. The city has served as a base for the monarchist forces in the south of Spain, where they have received British support through Gibraltar. With this victory, the monarchist cause is closer to being finished."
repspain.3.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

repspain.4.t:0 "Galicia Under Our Control"
repspain.4.d:0 "We have managed to push northwest and capture Galicia. The region has served through the civil war as a base for the Nationalist uprising. With this region under our control, we can say to have succeeded in securing the northern territories of Spain."
repspain.4.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

repspain.5.t:0 "Fall of the Monarchists!"
repspain.5.d:0 "The Monarchists and the Nationalists have been defeated, and with them, we have managed to defeat the forces that have tried to reestablish old and autocratic regimes over Spain. But while this is a victory for Spain, our country is still divided, now between Republicans and Socialists. Conflict will soon break out."

repspain.6.t:0 "Conflict With the Socialists"

repspain.7.t:0 "Valencia Under Our Control"
repspain.7.d:0 "We have managed to push east and capture Valencia. It is a beautiful city on the coast that has been under Socialist occupation since the start of the war. With the recapturing of this city, the Socialists will soon be defeated."

repspain.8.t:0 "Barcelona Under Our Control"
repspain.8.d:0 "We have managed to push northeast and capture Barcelona. It is one of the most important cities in Spain, and the center of the Socialist revolution. With this city firmly under our control, it will mark the end of the Socialists."
repspain.8.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

repspain.9.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
repspain.9.d:0 "The Spanish civil war is over. After an eternity of fighting, the Republicans have come out on top. While our success is grand, there will be difficulties following this victory."

repspain.11.t:0 "Anti-Government Protests"

repspain.13.t:0 "Socialist Criminal Gangs Established"

repspain.13.a:0 "Let the Police Get Them!"

repspain.14.t:0 "General Rojo Lluch's Proposal"
repspain.14.d:0 "General Vicente Rojo Lluch has approached the President and the government with the idea of establishing a provisional military government until new elections can be held. He argues that the stability of the Republic is, in the long run, more important than the unstable democratic institution. While this could be a good idea to regain some stability, there are many in the government that oppose such measures."
repspain.14.a:0 "Sorry, General. This Would Not Give off the Right Signals"
repspain.14.b:0 "It is Only Until the Election. Fine With Us"

repspain.15.t:0 "Returning Stability"
repspain.15.d:0 "While many were unhappy with our choice to establish a provisional military government, there have been promising results so far. With more control than a civilian government, we have managed to supress many monarchists and socialists in Spain."

repspain.16.t:0 "President Alcalá-Zamora Announces Plans to Step Down"
repspain.16.d:0 "With democracy and the republic returning to the Spanish nation, President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora has announced that he will soon step down and let the Cortes vote for who will become president in the aftermath of the recent election. The prime minister and most of the Cortes seems to agree with this notion. The official Presidential resignation will happen in a few days or weeks from now, and already there are some who would like to become the next President of Spain."
repspain.16.a:0 "Thanks for Your Service, Mister President"

repspain.17.t:0 "President Alcalá-Zamora Steps Down"
repspain.17.d:0 "Today, President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora stepped down as the president of the Spanish Republic. It will now be up to the Cortes to decide who will succeed him. While there is no shortage of candidates, many do not really have any chance to succeed. \n\nBut there are two possible candidates that can take on the role as President of Spain. The first is Manuel Azaña, leader of the Republican Left who served as prime minister through the civil war. He choice would be popular with socialists and left of center republicans, but not so popular with anyone else. The second is Alejandro Lerroux, leader of the Radical Republicans and a former prime minister of Spain. He would be popular in the republican center and with those who oppose Azaña as president, but not with the left-wing. It will nevertheless be up to the Cortes to decide who is going to be the next president of Spain."

repspain.100.d:0 "Recruitment propaganda in the territories we control seems to be working, with new men offering their services to the forces of the Spanish Republic in droves."
repspain.100.a:0 "Thank You For Your Participation"

repspain.101.t:0 "Army Loyalty Reassured"
repspain.101.d:0 "Colonels in the army who have had a history of being even slightly anti-republican have either been arrested, assassinated, or deported. The government believes that with this, the army's loyalty has been secured to protect Spain."
repspain.101.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

repspain.102.t:0 "Ready For the Election"
repspain.102.d:0 "Finally, preparation for the new elections can get underway. With our country recovered from the civil war and the enemies to the Republic all but destroyed, it is finally safe to hold a vote. We will see where the people want our country to go."
repspain.102.a:0 "Democracy is so Exciting"

repspain.103.t:0 "New Republican Election"
repspain.103.d:0 "Finally Spain is ready for new elections. While there have been concerns that we will try to directly influence the vote, in order to make the country vote in a certain way, the government has reassured the public many times that this will be a free election. There are two possible outcome of this election. Either the Republican Left will secure a majority, or the Republican Center and Right will secure their own. \n\nThe Republican left-wing is made up primarily of the Republican Left of Manuel Azaña, and the Republican Union of Diego Martínez Barrio. Smaller parties also exist in this alliance, among them some regionalist parties. The Republican Left wing wants to make Spain a secular and modern state, free from catholic influences. They also want to reintegrate the Socialists back into Spanish society. \n\nThe Republican Center and Right wing, by contrast, are made up primarily of the Radical Republican Party of Alejandro Lerroux and the Liberal Republican Right of President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, with smaller parties filling in the gaps. The Republican Center and Right have similar goals to the Republican Left, but are less radical and willing to reintegrate conservative forces back into Spanish society. \n\nIt would, for the most part, be up to the President on who he will approach in order to form a government. But in reality, these are the only two options."

The Prime Minister has revealed that these meetings will be the first steps in reintegrating the socialists back into Spanish politics. While the opposition opposes this, there is nothing stopping Azaña from doing it."
repspain.104.a:0 "Democracy Should be Allowed for Socialists Too"

repspain.105.t:0 "Francisco Largo Caballero Found Dead"
repspain.105.d:0 "News from Oslo has recently reached us that the socialist politician Francisco Largo Caballero was found dead in his apartment. It was obvious that someone had managed to force their way into his apartment and stab him in his chest. While some in the Norwegian government suspect that we had something to do with his death, they do not have concrete proof of it. Regardless of who did it, it is not good news when Spanish citizens are found dead."
repspain.105.a:0 "We Hope he Will Rest in Peace"

repspain.106.t:0 "Agreement With the Socialists"
repspain.106.d:0 "After hours of meetings and discussions, an agreement has been reached between the government and socialist politicans.

repspain.107.a:0 "Happy to Come to an Agreement"

repspain.108.t:0 "What To Do About Religious Education?"
repspain.108.d:0 "In our government, some have argued in favor of closing down schools that have a religious focus or are owned by religious organizations. They say that, just like how state and church shall be separate, so too should school and church. There are some that oppose this motion, arguing that there is nothing wrong with these schools, so long as they follow the law. A proposed law that bans religious education was passed in Cortes, and is ready for the president to sign it into law, should he choose to do so."
repspain.108.a:0 "The President Will Sign It"

While the opposition opposes this, there is nothing stoping Maura from doing it."

repspain.110.t:0 "José María Valiente Soriano Found Dead"

It was obvious that someone had managed to force their way into his apartment and shoot him in the head.

Regardless of who did it, it is not good news when Spanish citizens are found dead."

repspain.111.d:0 "After hours of meetings and discussions, an agreement has been reached between the government and conservative politicans. In order for the government to get their support, it has agreed to a list of demands. Among these demands is the demand of embracing some Catholic morals that can fit into our modern society. But with this agreement in hand, the government will have more support both in the Cortes and among the public."
repspain.111.a:0 "We Will Honour the Agreement"

repspain.112.t:0 "Negotiations With Renovación Española"
repspain.112.d:0 "The government has in recent days negotiated with politicians from the monarchist and conservative Renovación Española. While we have destroyed them in the civil war, they still sway some influence over the conservative right, and negotiations might be the way to reintegrate the right-wing of Spanish politics. Uphelding aspects of Religion and Tradition may have its positive sides after all."

repspain.150.t:0 "The Spanish Republic Wants to Join the Entente"
repspain.150.d:0 "Our southern neighbour, the Spanish Republic, has approached us in order to request entry into the Entente.

repspain.152.t:0 "The French Reject our Entry into the Entente"
repspain.152.d:0 "The French Republic has answered our request to join the Entente. Unfortunately, they have rejected us.

repspain.152.a:0 "This Will be Their Loss"

repspain.153.t:0 "The Spanish Republic Sends Support"
repspain.153.d:0 "The Spanish Republic has acknowledged our fight for freedom and republicanism, and has sent their support to us. We will of course reply with our thanks. Our eventual victory will usher in a new era of friendship and brotherhood between Spain and Portugal."

repspain.154.t:0 "A Latin Friendship"
repspain.154.d:0 "The ties between the Spanish and French Republics are growing stronger day by day. As latin countries, we share more than just having similar political systems.

We will of course oblige to their request, but there are differing views on how to welcome their Ambassador."

repspain.156.t:0 "Mexico Gives a Good Welcome to Our Ambassador"
repspain.156.d:0 "It was always a given that our embassy in Mexico would be returned to us. But the welcome our ambassador recieved was bigger than anything we could have imagined. Our Ambassador was greeted with good food and drink, celebrating with the Foreign Ministry of Mexico. This has indeed helped to build a strengthened relationship with our Hispanic brethren in Mexico City."
repspain.156.a:0 "This is a Good Sign"

repspain.157.t:0 "A Cold Welcome from Mexico"
repspain.157.d:0 "It was always a given that our embassy in Mexico would be returned to us. While we have no grounds to criticize the Mexican government on that front, they did give our Ambassador a relatively cold welcome. After being questioned by Mexican police, he was finally welcomed by a minor government official, who gave him the keys to the Embassy which he then had to walk to."

This has indeed helped to build a strengthened relationship with our Hispanic brethren along Río de La Plata."
repspain.159.a:0 "A Possible Argentine Friend"

repspain.160.t:0 "An Half-Hearted Argentine Welcome"
repspain.160.d:0 "It was always a given that our embassy in Argentina would be returned to us. While we have no ground to criticize the Argentine government on that front, they did give our Ambassador a rather half-hearted welcome, with a minor government employee simply handing him a letter and the keys. In the letter, they welcome us, but also request that we leave them out of our politics."

repspain.164.d:0 "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. Now, it is just those that strongly support the other factions, and strongly oppose us, that don't recognize us. We can truly proclaim with the worlds agreement, that we are the true government of Spain."

repspain.165.t:0 "International Trade Recognition"
repspain.165.d:0 "There is some countries that do not recognize us as the true and legitimate government of Spain.
