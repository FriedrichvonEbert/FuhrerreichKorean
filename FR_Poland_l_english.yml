POL_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Poland was reborn thanks to the Versailles. After more than a century of opression, the Polish people could once again taste freedom. But is this freedom safe? The enemy is on all sides, even inside the country. With revanchist Ukrainians to the east, expansionist Germans to the west and rising internal problems, the country will either fulfill the role of the "abomination of Versailles", or find its way through the new, yet not unfamiliar, surroundings. Will the Kingdom of Poland thrive and lead its people to glory? Or will it get destroyed once again, with its legacy perished in the ashes of modern warfare?"

poland.1.t:0 "폴란드 왕국"
poland.1.d:0 "Following the Partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, Poland regained its independence in November 11th 1919 thanks to the Treaty of Versailles. The Kingdom of Poland is a semi-constitutional monarchy, led by the king Franciszek I Radziwiłł, one of the most prominent Polish magnates. The revitalization of the country's industry and infrastructure, was abruptly halted by the Polish-Ukrainian war, which broke out in [FILL THIS WITH THE CORRECT DATE]. The Poles emerged victorious, holding onto their historical territory of Red Ruthenia. The victory however, wasn't merciful to the territory itself, leaving it utterly destroyed, and with that, problems emerged. As soon as the Marshal of Poland, Józef Piłsudski, retired from politics, and the new government was democratically elected, it was obvious that Polish politics will give the whole country a hard time. Numerous disagreements between, and within the parties, caused gridlocks which paralized the Sejm over and over again, forcing the King to disband it numerous times. The situation only worsened when the Prime Minister Gabriel Narutowicz, after a couple of months in office, was assasinated by a member of the right-wing party, the National Democracy (Narodowa Demokracja). Seeing the innefective polital system collapse under its own weight, in September 1926 Józef Piłsudski came back from his political retirement, and, with the consent of the King, assumed total power over the government and the Sejm. This stabilized the Polish "democracy", and lasted until Piłsudski fell ill in July 1935, and his influence and control over his supporters started fading away. The fights in the Sejm erupted once again, as strong as never before, with several parties splitting due to internal disagreements. The Polish King, for the third time, used his power to disband the government and the Sejm, but this time, only new Sejm elections were organised. Instead of electing a new government, the King appointed a group of advisors, to help him run the country. This state continues to this day, but the change may come any minute now, with Piłsudski's state of health getting only worse, and the Sejm starting to be inneffective as it always was."

In response to the death of one of most influencial and beloved Polish figures, the King has announced a national week of mourning. Piłsudski will be buried next to his mother, on a cementary in Vilnius, with all the honours the greatest commander of Poland shall get. With his death however, come another problems. His popularity among the population was keeping our state together for a long time. But now, with him gone, the parties in the parliament will possibly start to fall apart again, resulting in a disaster we already expierienced two times in the last 5 years. This is why we have to organise a great debate as soon as possible, in order to solve all problems before the whole aparatus of the Sejm's power will again vanish under the parties' disagreements and internal fights."

Śmigły stated that it should have the same power it had in the old days of the Polish-Bolshevik war, basically making it the most powerful government rank after the monarch.

The Social Liberal SL, which proposes a model of a benevolent dictatorship, which would help the poor and spread the wealth, and the Nationalist ND, which seeks to estabilish a homogenous Polish State, with the minorities sweeped to the margin."

The aim of the meeting is to decide the path for the new military dictatorship. Among many proposals, there are two which stand out, and are possibly the only viable options. Either we estabilish a centrist, benevolent dictatorship, and earn the support of the people through helping them, or we estabilish a nationalist government, with the aim of creating a homogenous Polish State, with the minorities sweeped to the margin, with barely any rights.

Now, the Polish government has decided to change it, by accepting a plan focused on fortyfing the western Polish border. Of course, such an investment is possible for the Polish, but they will certainly need some expierienced assistants, as they have never built such a thing before.

They know that their funds won't be enough to build fortifications great enough to stop a German advance into their fatherland, so they have turned to us, and seek financial help. This investment may be useful not only for them, as the finished fortifications will probably stop the Germans in Poland, long before they reach our land."

poland.74.b:0 "They can do it on their own"
poland.75.t:0 "Russian SSR refused to help"

All deposits, together with the cash that was stored in the bank's vault is gone, and the value of the robbed goods is estimated to be around 13.000.000 złoty! The robbers were profesionals and their action was perfectly coordinated. The police suspects that when one of the robbers waited in the bathroom for the bank to close, the rest was entering the building from the back, by drilling a hole in the wall of the adjacent house. After the bank has closed, the robber who previously was hiding, had incapacitated both guards, and obtained their keys, and later used them for a quick escape through the frontal door. We have to act fast, or the robbers will run away with all the valuables!"
poland.77.a:0 "Find them!"
poland.78.t:0 "They have vanished!"
poland.78.d:0 "Despite the great effort we put into finding any clues, there are literally none. We have searched the whole building, and there isn't even a single sign of their work, except the hole in the wall and opened deposit boxes."
poland.78.a:0 "How?! Look for something!"
poland.79.t:0 "Trails found!"
poland.79.d:0 "We found something! One of the policemen have came across a part of the car which the robbers, supposedly, used to escape. It seems that the driver hit the kerb, and a part of the car's bumper stayed on it. The police suspects that car was a white Opel Olimpia. Now, we just have to look for similar cars."

poland.80.t:0 "Nothing!"

poland.81.t:0 "Tools & weapons found!"
poland.81.d:0 "We found more clues! When searching the possible exit-routes from the city, the police patrol found a bag, containing all the tools that could be used to break into a bank, in the same fashion the robbers did. It is possible that we are very close to their hideout. We should concetrate our efforts on that area."
poland.81.a:0 "We are close!"
poland.82.t:0 "Mysterious Informator"
poland.82.d:0 "On today's evening, a bell rang on the Lwów's main police station. The night-shift guard has opened the door, but to his surprise, the only thing outside, was a letter on the welcome mat. He brought this letter to the commandant as fast as he could. Upon opening and reading it, it was already obvious how important this information is. We don't know the source, but somebody just revealed where the robbers are hiding! We need to get there and arrest them before they escape!"
poland.82.a:0 "Quick! Get them!"
poland.83.t:0 "Hideout"
poland.83.d:0 "We have secretly surrounded the robbers' hideout. Scouts claim that they are still inside. All units are ready to storm the house. However, there is a danger that the robbers will try to burn the money they have stolen, and we can't risk to loose it. They are also supposedly heavily armed. Should we try to negotiate?"
poland.83.a:0 "Let's negotiate"
poland.83.b:0 "Raid the hideout!"
poland.84.t:0 "Ultimatum!"
poland.84.d:0 "In response to our negotiation attempts, the robbers have issued an ultimatum. They demand half of the robbed money for themselves, a car, and a possibility to drive away without the police chasing them. These demands are obviously absurd, but this is the only way we can prevent an unnecessary blood-bath in the hideout and having our money destroyed."
poland.84.a:0 "We accept it"
poland.84.b:0 "Their demands are unnaceptable! Prepare the raid!"
poland.85.t:0 "They are gone!"
poland.85.d:0 "After accepting the demands, we have withdrawed all units from the house's surroundings. The robbers left the house, entered the car, and drived away. As soon as they left the estate, we have sent a group of police cars after them, but, to their surprise, the cars, and with it, the robbers, vanished. They have tricked us once again. On the bright side, the suspects left the promised half of the money in the house."
poland.85.a:0 "Again?!"
poland.86.t:0 "Raid report"
poland.86.d:0 "A swift police raid was executed. The first unit entered the house from the front through the main door, immediately getting caught in a cross-fire during which 4 policemen were wounded and 2 were killed. The second police unit entered the house through the basement entrance located outside the house, and after forcing their way into the house through the barricaded basement doors, managed to kill one robber without casualities. The other suspect escaped upstairs, where he had locked himself in a room and barricaded it. Before the police managed to break the door down, the suspect burned 3/4 of the robbed money, and set up a "defensive position" using a flipped toppled wardrobe and a table. It took another 2 killed policemen to force him out of there and kill him. This unsucessful action will for sure make it to the tommorow's newspaper headlines."
poland.86.a:0 "What a failure"
poland.87.t:0 "Possible hideout found!"
poland.87.d:0 "Great news! The police patrols have found a possible hideout in the surroundings of a small village near the main road. While we aren't entirely sure if the reports are true, we have already played cat and mouse long enough. It is time to raid their safe spot and get our money back!"
poland.87.a:0 "Raid it!"
poland.88.t:0 "Wrong house!"
poland.88.d:0 "The reports were mistaken! We have raided a house belonging to innocent civilians! The public opinion is thrilled and this will for sure make it to the tommorow's newspaper headlines. This was the biggest embarassment in the whole existance of the Polish Police Force."
poland.88.a:0 "Who is responsible for this?!"
poland.89.t:0 "They have escaped!"
poland.89.d:0 "Today, the police have found a possible hideout of the robbers. It is located in the woods, not far away from one of the main exit-routes from the city. Sadly, it is empty. The robbers are gone, and so is our money."

POLITICS_FRANCISZEK_RADZIWILL_DESC:0 "King Franciszek I Radziwiłł (full name: Janusz Franciszek Ksawery Józef Labre Bronisław Maria Radziwiłł) (Born in Berlin on September 3rd, 1880) is a polish nobleman and a king of the Kingdom of Poland.\n\n During the Great War he found himself on the Russian side of the frontline, in his family estate in Ołyka in Volhynia. There, he organised help for the refugees from the Congress Poland. In 1918, as the supporter of the Regency Council, he came back to Poland and became a member of the Jan Kanty Steczkowski's government as the Director of the State Department. He was responsible for the Polish foreign policy and developing the Polish diplomatic ties around the world.In the summer of 1918 he held diplomatic talks with the German and Austrian emperors, Wilhelm II and Carl I, about the future of the Kingdom of Poland. During the meeting they considered various candidacies for the crown of the Kingdom of Poland. During the meeting he also refused to be a candidate for the crown of the Kingdom of Lithuania, as he was a cousin of the German emperor. In 1919 he tried to become a part of the Polish diplomatic mission to the Conference of Versailles, but failed. Nonetheless, to his surprise, on the Versailles Conference, the Regency Council was proclaimed the only legal government of Poland. Then, on November 20th, he was chosen by the Council to become the new King. It was obvious that the decision was pushed by the Entente Powers, due to Radziwiłł's royal ties to various royal families of europe. One month later, Janusz Radziwiłł was officialy coronated and he chose the second name Franciszek as his royal name. "
POL_Edward_Rydz_Smigly_desc:0 "Known as Józef Piłsudski's heir, Rydz-Śmigły obtained his fame after his deeds in the Polish-Ukrainian War,halting the Ukrainian advances through methods similiar in manner to those used on the western front during the Great War. Developing a line of defences, he allowed his superior, Piłsudski, to focus on dismantling the encircled Ukrainian troops defending in local areas.\n This experience and other factors led to him choosing well dug-in defence as the conflict-winning tactic."
