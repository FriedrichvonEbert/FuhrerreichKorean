### DESCRIPTION ###
KOR_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "An independent Korean state hasn't existed since the Japanese protectorate was established in 1905. In 1936 Korea still looms under the Japanese thumb, but increasing feelings of nationalism and anti-Japanese sentiment threatens to upset the delicate balance in the region. Whether the Koreans will liberate themselves or simply have overlordship transfered from one power to another remains to be seen, but the Korean peninsula is sure to see devestation in the years to come no matter what."

### EVENTS ###

kor.1.t:0 "Coastal Border Dispute"
kor.1.d:0 "Forces from the Communist North Korean state have recently encroached upon what we claim as our territory near the Western coastline, and several skirmishes have already taken place. Militarists in our party believe that we should escalate this dispute in order to take the territory back and perhaps invade the North Korean state while the Soviets are distracted with European affairs, however many European adivsors stationed in our country advise that attempting to antagonize the North Koreans may lead to full blown foreign intervention and the start of a new global war."
kor.1.a:0 "Korea is indivisible!"
kor.1.b:0 "A few coastal islands are nothing to start a global nuclear war over."
