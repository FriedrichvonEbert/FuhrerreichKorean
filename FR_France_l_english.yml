#Description
FRA_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "'승리했지만, 그 대가는 무엇이였는가?' 대전쟁은 끝나고, 많은 프랑스인들이 이렇게 묻고 있습니다. 프랑스는 정당한 영토를 되찾았으며, 독일인들이 다신 조국을 위협하지 못하도록 라인란트에 보호령도 설립했습니다. 그렇지만, 1930년대가 끝나가며 유럽과 세계에서의 프랑스의 지위는 프랑스의 식민지를 위협하고 있는 적대적인 대영제국과 점차 호전적으로 변해가는 소련에 의해 위협받고 있습니다. 그렇지만 그 무엇보다도 중요한 문제는 대전쟁으로부터 회복한 독일이겠지요. 다가오는 폭풍으로부터 살아남으려면, 프랑스에겐 신중함, 용기, 그리고 휼륭한 외교를 필요로 할 것입니다.

The French defeat in the Franco-Prussian war left them bitter and spiteful towards the Germans, and this feeling would last another 40 years before they were allowed their revenge on the fields of the Great War. \n\nWith the end of the world’s most devastating conflict in 1919, the French were quick to enforce harsh demands upon the German nation. Full responsibility for damages caused by the war and a seemingly insurmountable series of debt payments destroyed the German economy and helped to bring France back to their hegemonic status in Europe. These economic burdens placed upon Germany, as well as the allied occupation of the Ruhr and Rhineland, forced Germany to default on their debts, and the nation went bankrupt. \n\nWhen German reperation payments stopped coming in, the French were forced to invade the Rhineland region and set up an Inter-Allied joint commission to administer the region. Along with this invasion of the Rhineland, the Saarland was occupied directly by the French army, in direct opposition from the Italians, British, and Americans, who had all participated in the occupation of the Rhineland. With the cecession of German reperation payments in 1933, exploitation of both the Rhineland and Saarland increased dramatically, leading to the Saarland being incorperated into the French Republic as the Sarre department. \n\nBy 1936, the ruling Bloc National continues to dominate French politics, seemingly unaware of the resurgant German power."

Several diffrent previaling schools of thought have taken hold, and the arguments nearly turned violent before the Chief of Army stepped in to mediate the situation. \n\nWhat followed were a series of live wargames in the Pas-de-Calais region of France, with one side representing Germany and the other representing France. What the officers found was that using conventional tactics, both armies were forced into a state of trench warfare within weeks of the simulated war beginning. A promising new "Guerre éclair" tactic showed many signs of success, involving a lightly armoured spearhead which would punch through the enemy lines before spreading out like a funnel, allowing allied soldiers to capture huge swaths of enemy troops and hostile land. Combined with an air offensive, it was believed that this new "Lightning War" could potentially turn the tide in France's favour during the next major continential war. \n\nIt was not soon after, however, that several officers found major faults with the plan. Fuel and supply shortages were rampant with this doctrine, and the risk of being cutoff from the main army was extremely high if the enemy force were able to break through the spearhead. It was for these reasons that the plan was essentially scrapped by the end of the wargames. \n\nWe may not have found our magical new doctrine, but the army has certainly learned a thing or two about fighting a modern, defensive war."

The movement has once more swelled in numbers due to an influx of disgruntled citizens within the city joining their ranks. Several French generals have drawn up plans to forcefully disband this march using several of our experienced divisions currently stationed in Africa, however this idea has been completely blocked due to an unwillingness in the government to fire upon its own citizens and possibly incite another revolution in the nation. \n\nThe Workers March moves on in a generally Northward heading, and many political observers believe that they will dissipate when met with the Loire river and it's low-capacity bridges."

Estimates put the volume of the crowd anywhere between 600 and 900 people, and growing constantly. Several recon divisions have been shadowing the March since they passed through La Rochelle, and a clearly defined group appears to be leading the entire march, most of which are wearing red attire and carrying around blood-red flags. It would seem that as time goes on, the March becomes more and more socialist in nature, with many of the participants joining in the singing of "La Internationale" on a daily basis. \n\nThe leadership of our government has become quite frightened, and several divisions have been placed both in and around Paris as a preventitive measure in case the March does reach the city, but many citizens are doubtful that they will be able to stop this march if it continues for much longer."

The East half of Paris is relatively untouched by the march due to the Seine River cutting the city in two, but the Arc de Triomphe has already been overrun and a red banner has been hoisted over the monument. The Palais Bourbon is within spitting distance of the now-rebel army, and many fear that a Second Paris Commune may soon become a reality, and the French military is finding it harder and harder to keep the rebels at bay without resorting to violence.
