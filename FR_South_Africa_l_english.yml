#### Description ####
SAF_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "The Third Boer War, an uprising of Afrikaaner nationalists during the Great War, led to the banishment of Boers from South African politics and the rise of a new nation based - at least partially - on integrity and equality. Today, the Boers are once again on the rise, and South Africans must contend with whether they want to remain a part of an Empire that takes them for granted or split off and forge their own, dangerous new path."

#### Ideas ####
SAF_Black_Wednesday:0 "Economic Catastrophe"
SAF_Black_Wednesday_desc:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has hit South Africa hard. Our industry and local economies are crippled, and may never recover if we do not take immediate action."
SAF_Black_Wednesday2:0 "Economic Crash"
SAF_Black_Wednesday2_desc:0 "The global economic crash is obliterating our domestic economy, but we have begun government intervention efforts in an attempt to mitigate and eventually reverse its effects."
SAF_Black_Wednesday3:0 "Economic Crash"
SAF_Black_Wednesday3_desc:0 "The global economic crash is obliterating our domestic economy, and we cannot risk losing political power through government intervention. Austerity is the best way to let the hand of the markets correct their mistake."
SAF_Black_Wednesday4:0 "Economic Crisis"
SAF_Black_Wednesday4_desc:0 "Our efforts to intervene in our nation's economic crisis have been largely successful, though we still have a long way to go."
SAF_Black_Wednesday5:0 "Economic Crisis"
SAF_Black_Wednesday5_desc:0 "Our decision to stay out of the economic crisis is beginning to pay off. The markets are beginning their long arc to correction."
SAF_Black_Wednesday6:0 "Economic Recovery"
SAF_Black_Wednesday6_desc:0 "We are very near to completing our recovery from the London Stock Market Crash. Just one final push is all that remains."
SAF_Black_Wednesday7:0 "Economic Recovery"
SAF_Black_Wednesday7_desc:0 "We are very near to completing our recovery from the London Stock Market Crash. Soon the markets will correct their mistakes."
SAF_Rhodesia_Unrest:0 "Unrest in Rhodesia"
SAF_Rhodesia_Unrest_desc:0 "Despite becoming a part of our nation well over a decade ago, the people of Rhodesia continue to resist full integration into our Union. This has been a large strain on our economy for many years, and many members in the House of Assembly have spent their careers attempting to solve what appears to be an increasingly unsolvable problem."
SAF_Integration_Resist:0 "Resistance to Integration"
SAF_Integration_Resist_desc:0 "The conflict between the Boers and the rest of South African society is one which stretches as far back as memory can tell, and its effects continue to persist with us today. Many Boers living in the Transvaal or the Orange Free State will resist any efforts by our government to further integrate South African Natives into our society as semi-equals. The continued strains on our nation's culture and governance in this area seem to tear our nation in two - something which some in the House believe is entirely possible if nothing is done."
SAF_Boer_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Boer Wars"
SAF_Boer_Legacy_desc:0 "While the Boer Wars have cost our society and our people much over the past half-century, they have also taught us valuable lessons in how to wage war, particularly in the realms of guerilla warfare. However unlikely a war in our homeland may appear to be, we must always be vigilant and ready for it should it come."
SAF_Boer_Legacy1:0 "Legacy of the Boer Wars"
SAF_Boer_Legacy1_desc:0 "While the Boer Wars have cost our society and our people much over the past half-century, they have also taught us valuable lessons in how to wage war, particularly in the realms of guerilla warfare. However unlikely a war in our homeland may appear to be, we must always be vigilant and ready for it should it come."
SAF_Boer_Legacy2:0 "Legacy of the Boer Wars"
SAF_Boer_Legacy2_desc:0 "While the Boer Wars have cost our society and our people much over the past half-century, they have also taught us valuable lessons in how to wage war, particularly in the realms of guerilla warfare. However unlikely a war in our homeland may appear to be, we must always be vigilant and ready for it should it come."
SAF_Anti_British_Sentiment:0 "Anti-British Sentiment"
SAF_Anti_British_Sentiment_desc:0 "Over the past decade, the British Empire has continuously stepped upon the backs of the South African people to reach prosperity. From their revocation of their territorial promises to our Union to their outright refusal to pass the Statute of Westminster, Parliament in London has shown how little they regard our people. As such, a sense of anti-British sentiment currently permeates our nation and continues to influence our domestic and foreign policy going forward."
SAF_Boers_Enraged:0 "Boers Enraged"
SAF_Boers_Enraged_desc:0 "While we have worked at reforming South Africa to become a better nation, the Boers have become more and more unruly, threatening open revolt as their racist dream collapses before their eyes."
SAF_Integrated_Society:0 "Integrated Society"
SAF_Integrated_Society_desc:0 "South Africa has struggled for decades with issues of race and segregation. While the nation is far from perfect, and while work still remains to be done, South Africa is officially an integrated - rather than a segregated - society. It is the first of many steps to a new dawn in our history and the beginning of a new, greater nation."
SAF_Integrated_Society1:0 "Native Rights Restored"
SAF_Integrated_Society1_desc:0 "The Native South Africans - who were here long before European settlers - deserve just as many rights as the rest of the nation. The acts that the House of Assembly has passed have started us on the path to restoring those rights to them."
SAF_Integrated_Society2:0 "Legislated Equality"
SAF_Integrated_Society2_desc:0 "Some South Africans - the Boers in particular - have shown a strong opposition to granting equal rights and legal equality to the entire country. The legislation passed by the House of Assembly takes the first steps in legislating equality, despite their protests."
SAF_Integrated_Society3:0 "Bill of Rights"
SAF_Integrated_Society3_desc:0 "By enshrining a Bill of Rights into law, the House of Assembly has successfully shown the world that South Africa is ready to finally move into the 20th century and rid itself of the racist thinking of its old segregationist governments."
SAF_Stabilized_Society:0 "Stabilized Society"
SAF_Stabilized_Society_desc:0 "Just a few years ago, South Africa was far from stable, and a few even feared a collapse of its entire society. Yet today, our society is stabilized, thanks to the many laws and acts passed by the House of Assembly which worked to rid the nation of segregationist institutions and create a new, equal country for all."
SAF_Stabilized_Society1:0 "Future Guarantees"
SAF_Stabilized_Society1_desc:0 "By telling protestors that we will follow through on guarantees in the future, we have effectively pushed many issues a long way down the road, giving us time today to improve our government enough to handle them when the time comes."
SAF_Stabilized_Society2:0 "Promised Change"
SAF_Stabilized_Society2_desc:0 "Change is never easy for a nation, but promising it is as easy as it is harmless, and goes a long way in quelling unrest."
SAF_Stabilized_Society3:0 "Status Quo Steady"
SAF_Stabilized_Society3_desc:0 "The United Government has proven its worth to South Africa by maintaining the status quo while also stabilizing the country. While South African society just a few years ago was on the brink of collapse, today it is more stable than ever before."
SAF_Independent_Society:0 "Independent Society"
SAF_Independent_Society_desc:0 "Finally free from the tyranny of British oppression and laws, South African society has had a rebirth in freedom and fraternity."
SAF_Independent_Society1:0 "Removal Policy"
SAF_Independent_Society1_desc:0 "While the liberals in South Africa have always wanted to grant equality to the masses, the government in power is hell-bent on imposing stability with an iron fist. Hence, it has prioritized relocating the Natives which have caused so much unrest in the rest of the nation."
SAF_Independent_Society2:0 "New Courts"
SAF_Independent_Society2_desc:0 "The old courts of South Africa, based in British law and superiority, were corrupt and weak. The new courts, as created by the nationalist government, are controlled by the state and work to advance its aims."
SAF_Independent_Society3:0 "New Constitution"
SAF_Independent_Society3_desc:0 "The new constitution crafted by the nationalist government of South Africa calls for an independent nation and a number of radical and systematic changes that are condemned by most of the rest of the world but are seeing little resistance in the semi-authoritarian state that South Africa has become."
SAF_British_Friendship:0 "British Friendship"
SAF_British_Friendship_desc:0 "Friendship between South Africans and their British bretheren is breathing new life into South African society, encouraging cooperation and dissuading the nationalist rhetoric which has plagued its government for decades."
SAF_Independence_at_Last:0 "Independence at Last"
SAF_Independence_at_Last_desc:0 "South Africa finds itself fully free and independent from their once-British overlords. Where the nation will go from here, no one knows."
SAF_Ver_Supply:0 "Versatile Supply"
SAF_Ver_Supply_desc:0 "Versatile supply lines allow for more ambitious operations deep in enemy territory, and can help soldiers out of a pinch when necessary."
SAF_Scorched_Earth:0 "Scorched Earth Policy"
SAF_Scorched_Earth_desc:0 "By destroying the land that is being fought over, armies can ensure each others' starvation and the weakening of partisan activity that might occur behind the front lines."
SAF_Land_Supply:0 "Living off the Land"
SAF_Land_Supply_desc:0 "Training soldiers to live not only off of supplies but also off of the land they occupy is crucial to creating an ideal army capable of long offensives."
SAF_British_Shipbuilding:0 "British Shipbuilding"
SAF_British_Shipbuilding_desc:0 "If we wish to have a navy capable of rivaling those of the other Dominions, we must swallow our pride and continue relying on the British to build our ships."
SAF_South_African_Shipbuilding:0 "South African Shipbuilding"
SAF_South_African_Shipbuilding_desc:0 "The Union is more than capable of building a navy capable of rivaling those of the rest of the world on its own. We don't need to rely on the British to build our ships."
SAF_Boer_Revolt:0 "Boer Revolt"
SAF_Boer_Revolt_desc:0 "The revolt against the South African government by the Boer nationalists has crippled our industry, and will leave lasting scars on our society that we will struggle to heal."
SAF_Boer_Revolt2:0 "Boer Revolt"
SAF_Boer_Revolt2_desc:0 "The damage to our industries by the Boer nationalists is under repair, but our army and government remain at a near-standstill domestically while we still struggle to heal."
SAF_Boer_Revolt3:0 "Boer Revolt"
SAF_Boer_Revolt3_desc:0 "The damage to our industries and army by the Boer nationalists is under repair, but our government remains at a near-standstill domestically while we still struggle to heal."

#### Focus ####
SAF_Union_Army:0 "The Union Army"

SAF_Legacy_Great_War:0 "Legacy of the Great War"

SAF_Versatile_Supply_desc:0 "To have a versatile army, we must have a versatile supply line - one that can keep up with speed and mobility."
SAF_Planning_Initiatives:0 "Planning Initiatives"
SAF_Planning_Initiatives_desc:0 "No army or offensive can be executed without excellent and flawless planning. We must ensure that our planners show initiative for any conflicts that might come."
SAF_Offensive_Tactics:0 "Offensive Tactics"
SAF_Offensive_Tactics_desc:0 "Offensive tactics are vital in mobile warfare. We must learn how to take the fight to the enemy rather than sit by and let them come to us."
SAF_Through_the_Hills:0 "Through the Hills"
SAF_Through_the_Hills_desc:0 "We must understand that war is not only about attacking but also defending. And the easiest place to defend our home is in the hills. We must ensure that our soldiers are equipped to do so."
SAF_Legacy_Boer_War:0 "Legacy of the Boer Wars"
SAF_Legacy_Boer_War_desc:0 "The Boer Wars have taught us much about guerilla warfare and fighting in the hills and mountains. We must learn from them so as to avoid repeating them - or, if necessary, win them faster."
SAF_Shock_Initiatives:0 "Shock Initiatives"
SAF_Shock_Initiatives_desc:0 "Shock and awe is very effective in disrupting enemy movements and scattering them. If we focus on quick, in-and-out shock initiatives, we could put the tactic to very effective use."

SAF_Scorched_Earth:0 "Scorched Earth"
SAF_Scorched_Earth_desc:0 "Our soldiers must be equipped to raze everything they find if necessary. The Boers hid in farmhouses and fields during their wars. We must make sure that our enemies cannot do the same."

SAF_Union_Navy_desc:0 "While we still rely on Britain to provide protection at sea, we are a coastal nation, and as such may want to see how much we can start providing for ourselves."
SAF_Imperial_Reliance:0 "Reliance on the Imperial Navy"
SAF_Imperial_Reliance_desc:0 "While creating our own navy is an appealing idea, it is both impractical and a waste of funds. Continuing to rely on the Imperial Navy provides us the protection we seek and favor from London at the same time."
SAF_Buy_Old_Ships:0 "Buy Old Ships"
SAF_Buy_Old_Ships_desc:0 "Britain would be happy to sell us some of its more outdated battleships. It's better than having to build our own, and keeps money in the Imperial economy."

SAF_Submarine_Warfare_desc:0 "Times have changed, as has warfare on the high seas. Submarines are vessels of destruction, capable of decimating entire convoys. This is the future of naval warfare, and a future we should pursue."
SAF_Reliance_on_Ourselves:0 "Reliance On Ourselves"
SAF_Reliance_on_Ourselves_desc:0 "The Imperial Navy has served its purpose, but what happens if the Empire should become our enemy? We must begin relying on ourselves and create a navy of our own, entirely under our control."
SAF_Protect_Our_Shores:0 "Protect Our Shores"
SAF_Protect_Our_Shores_desc:0 "While our army is more than capable of defending our nation by land, we still risk a naval invasion by sea. Our navy must be well-equipped to protect our shores and ensure the security of our people."

SAF_War_Exercises:0 "War Exercises"
SAF_War_Exercises_desc:0 "Any good general of planner knows that the best way for the air force to practice is to hold war exercises. Our enemies can appear from anywhere at any time, so we must always be ready and vigilant."

SAF_The_SAAF:0 "The SAAF"
SAF_The_SAAF_desc:0 "We cannot continue to rely upon things that the Empire has already created. The Royal Air Force is renowned for its strength and skill. The South African Air Force, however, will be far better."

SAF_Unity_with_Colonies:0 "Unity with the Colonies"
SAF_Unity_with_Colonies_desc:0 "Our sister colonies in Africa are facing the same hardships as we are. By reaffirming our commitment to a common cause in this dire time we can potentially secure extremely helpful long-term contracts and funds."

SAF_Prioritize_Transvaal_desc:0 "Our resources in reversing the crises caused by the London Stock Market Crash must revolve around the extraction of our resources and the calming of the unrest in the Transvaal. Expanding mining operations there should help fix both situations."

southafrica.1.t:0 "The Union of South Africa"
southafrica.1.d:0 "Ex Unitate Vires. Union is strength. \n\nThe Union of South Africa is in turmoil. While the Third Boer War, fought alongside the end of the Great War, successfully ended any further thoughts of Boer resistance, the situation in South Africa has deteriorated over the past twenty years, and could soon see a resurgence of violence not seen since that conflict. Following its 1922 annexation of Rhodesia and its its 1926 acquisition of Bechuanaland, the nation was beset by protests, riots, and violence. Denied a referendum on joining the Union, wealthy Rhodesian settlers demanded independence, while the natives in Bechuanaland and the rest of South Africa grew restless in the light of continued oppression and segregation. Today, these violent elements draw close to a breaking point. \n\nThe House of Assembly is currently run by the National Party, which itself is growing increasingly anti-British following the passage of the Statute of Autonomy, with some fringe MPs demanding complete independence from the Empire altogether. The opposing South Africa Party finds the opposite problem; a lack of popularity because of its much more moderate positions and willingness to continue South African expansion without addressing existing issues in Rhodesia and the Kalahari Territory. Yet both parties face an increasingly polarized society between the Afrikaner and English populations, and cultural and racial tension throughout the nation. Other fringe elements in society, including the much more liberal African National Congress and the much more nationalist Osswabrandwag Party, also seek a say in the nation’s government. Much hinges on the upcoming 1937 elections. \n\nSoon, the nation will have to make a choice between anti-Imperialists and Dominionists, integration and separation, and expansion or self-reflection."

southafrica.2.d:0 "The All-African Congress of various representatives from across the country met in December of last year, and has released official statements from its meeting. The organization has condemned the National government’s attempts to further segregate whites and Native black Africans, which have been spearheaded by extremist elements of the National Party. The All-African Congress also called for a roundtable discussion with representatives of both parties involved to come to a quick and peaceful resolution. While the All-African Congress is little more than a liberal protest organization, it may be wise to consider their words."

Hertzog, the Prime Mister of South Africa, along with Jan Smuts, leader of the opposition South African Party, announced today that Smuts's Members of Parliament will be merging with those of the governing National Party to form the new 'United Party'. Smuts and Hertzog said that such a merger will lead to much-needed unity in the House of Assembly, though moderates in the South African Party and extremists in the National Party alike have balked at the move, declaring allegiance to two entirely new parties; the Dominion Party and Purified National Party. It remains to be seen how voters will react to the merger of the two rival parties in the next election."

southafrica.4.d:0 "As part of the agreement between the former parties that now make up the United government, the House of Assembly has agreed to hold hearings and debates on a series of bills designed to address the current voting rolls. Nationalist Afrikaners in the Transvaal support purging the voter rolls of all Native African voters and transferring them to a separate roll. Doing this would spit in the face of British Parliament, who still frowns upon our history of discrimination. Yet if we refuse, we risk further fracturing our fragile coalition."
southafrica.4.a:0 "We can't risk the wrath of the nationalists. Create a voter roll for the Natives."

southafrica.5.d:0 "Having created a separate voter roll for all Native African voters, the House of Assembly is obligated to determine what this new roll shall be used for. Currently, it only serves to list African voters separately. Extremists and nationalists, however, have pushed to bar Natives from voting for members of the legislature entirely, only allowing them to vote for four representatives at large who will represent their interests before the House. Liberal groups, and even some in the United Party, are balking at this blatant segregation, but national extremists are adament that it must be done for them to maintain their loyalty to the United government."

Nationalist elements of the United Party and the new Purified National Party have put forth legislation which would give the government authority to forcibly remove Natives who live in areas surrounded by white settlers and expand reservations in other provinces. Critics of the bills suggest that this could empower the government to relocate Natives from most of the country entirely. Once again, we are faced with a choice between what's right and what we need to keep our standing in the House."

Nationalists and leaders of the Purified National Party are claiming that the South African economy would still remain strong today if it had rejected the authority of Parliament and left the Empire entirely. While many understand that this is blatantly false, there is still a general sense of animosity towards the British growing amongst the populace.

While we were prepared to be accomodating at first, the recent Indian Revolt and continued instability in the region has turned the immigrant stream into a flood. In order to keep more nationalists from abandoning the United Party, it has agreed to hear a series of anti-Indian and anti-immigration bills in the House of Assembly.

While the office is largely tied to the wishes of the cabinet, this still appears to be a sign of good faith from Parliament. Hertzog is himself a South African national, and by ascending to the Governor-Generalship, he leaves the position of Prime Minister open to Jan Smuts.

Motivated by the continued economic crisis and lack of autonomy, the protestors have successfully shut down most of the area's industry. While the United government has conceded token promises, the ANC has promised the province an independence referendum if they are elected next year. Going easy on them now may convince some voters to stay home next June, but if we do nothing we risk losing the entire province to violence."

southafrica.12.d:0 "Various leaders of the African National Congress have begun touring the country in an attempt to revive dormant branches of the party and gain a better foothold among voters for the upcoming elections. \n\nWhile the ANC has traditionally been viewed as a party with very little chance of victory, party leadership also announced today that it will be joining with the Labour and Dominion Parties in a liberal coalition. Should the three parties gain a combined number of seats to form a new government, it intends to implement a series of new liberal reforms to address the nation's many issues...."

For several months now, they have been fueling speculation among their relatively low voter base that they intend to cast their support for the ANC-Labour-Dominion coalition. Today, party leaders have announced their intentions."

southafrica.14.d:0 "A relatively small organization to begin with, the Transvaal Indian Party has launched a mass protest in the heavily Afrikaner state of Transvaal over the recent legislation which has heavily restricted Indian immigration in light of the recent chaos in the region. The protests have been surprisingly effective, though they have been met with violence. If we cave to them now, however, we show weakness just before the election. Yet if we ignore them, the Afrikaners in the region may take matters into their own hands."

Whether the United Party will hold onto power, the ANC coalition will take charge, or the Purified National Party will impose its own form of order will have been determined by their impressions on the voters over the past several months. The last two years of party mergers, controversial legislation, economic collapse, and strikes and riots have led to this..."

southafrica.16.t:0 "The ANC Coalition Wins"
southafrica.16.d:0 "The liberal coalition between the African National Congress, Labour Party, and Dominion Party has won enough seats in the House of Assembly to form a government.

southafrica.17.d:0 "Despite signs over the past two years that the fragile United Party would collapse under the pressure of South Africa's many issues, the party has managed to maintain enough of its seats in the House of Assembly to maintain its majority government. While the United Party has conceded ground to nationalists in the time since its creation, party leaders are now vowing to keep South Africa on a stable and steady path into the future."

southafrica.18.d:0 "The Purified National Party, working alongside the controversial Roos Party, has managed to win a majority of the seats in the House of Assembly.

southafrica.19.d:0 "Today, the current Governor General of South Africa - Lord Hyde - has announced that he intends to resign from the post. South Africa has faced many growing troubles in recent years, so it is only fitting that we appoint a new Governor General who will be able to deal with them. The question, however, becomes who? Some in our Cabinet have suggested appointing Patrick Duncan, a longtime supporter of the Empire who helped fight against the Afrikaners in the Boer War. Yet others say that appointing Duncan would enrage nationalists in South Africa and make matters there worse, suggesting that we appoint current South African Prime Minister J.B.M. Hertzog instead to calm them. Our decision may directly impact upcoming South African elections, so we must be choose carefully."

southafrica.24.d:0 "Segregation has long been a stain on our nation - both at home and abroad. It remains a legacy of a racist past, and we have resolved to doing everything in our power to prevent it from becoming a racist future. Today, legislators in the House of Assembly managed to pass a bill which outlaws all kinds of segregation that our government has implemented over the past several decades, finally bringing our goal of nationwide equality to fruition. This is long in the making - two decades ago, every South African political party supported segregation in some form or another. But after the Third Boer War, and the widespread political realignment that gripped the nation, South Africa has begun to turn over a new leaf. /n/nOf course, there are a number of protestors in the Transvaal, Orange Free State, and Natal who have threatened violence in response. These people, calling themselves the Boers Reborn, will be nothing but trouble. Already, a number of nationalist politicians have walked out of the House intent on joining them. Whether this will force a government show of force or not remains to be seen."

southafrica.25.t:0 "Segregation Halted"
southafrica.25.d:0 "South Africa has embraced a racist set of laws and institutions that have discriminated against its Native population for far too long. With the recent passage of a series of bills, the House of Assembly has effectively outlawed segregation and begun the long process of dismantling the institutions that have held South Africa back from true progress for more than half a century. While most political parties in South Africa supported segregation not more than two decades ago, the Third Boer War and the resulting political realignment have made way for a new school of thought, one that we will spearhead with moderate reforms. The Boers in the Transvaal have, of course, gone ballistic at the move, blaming the government of corruption and abuse of power. Yet for many in the rest of the nation, this is the beginning of a brand new era - one which will hopefully bring about peace and stability for all."
southafrica.25.a:0 "Let there be calm. We have addressed the issue."

southafrica.26.t:0 "Segregation Enshrined"
southafrica.26.d:0 "Our nation has long struggled to come to terms with the conflict between Natives and settlers. The British refused to take action, and the settlers in Cape have always sought 'equality' and 'integration.' After the Third Boer War, political parties shut Boer voices out of government and legislated as they saw fit. Yet now, with the Boers in control of our government, we find that they have the ability to enshrine segregation into law. Doing so will no doubt enrage Natives and those in Cape Province, who continue to demand a public referendum on the matter and threaten mass protest if denied."

southafrica.27.d:0 "With the new ANC coalition government seated in the House of Assembly, the Prime Minister has called for a special legislative session designed to address the growing problems in our country. \n\nAmong the bills under deliberation are several which would grant extensive rights to Native South Africans, desegregate the nation's institutions, and offer a number of concessions to protestors throughout the country. On the docket are also bills which would enshrine these rights in the nation's constitution and seek further cooperation and friendship with the British government. \n\nThe Nationalists in the House have threatened to boycott the session, leading to many in the ANC to call for their removal from the legislative body should they be absent. Such a move will undoubtebly anger the Boers in the Transvaal, but the Prime Minister has deemed it necessary to continue with the historic session. South Africa is starting on a new path, and it is all we can do to guide it in the right direction."

While this is certainly within our power, it is entirely possible that such an election could see our party lose its majority in the House of Assembly to the newly-formed coalition between the ANC, the Dominion Party, and the Labour Party or the long-standing nationalist coalition between the Sentrale Party, Purified National Party, and OB. \n\nUnfortunately, the situation has left us without a choice, and we are forced to call for new elections in June of 1937.

D.F. Malan, Prime Minister and leader of the Purified National Party, declared that the Union was strong, as strong as any European power and by far the strongest nation on the continent of Africa. For too long, South Africa has been overshadowed by Britain's Dominions. But starting today, it shall be we who cast the shadows.

southafrica.32.d:0 "The Union of South Africa has again petitioned us to grant it another one of our colonies following the transfer of our High Commissioner Territories; this one in North Rhodesia. North Rhodesia, unlike the Territories, however, provides us with continued rare and extremely valuable resources. While those resources would remain in the Empire and the IPA, it may be risky to give them away. Nonetheless, North Rhodesia was the last piece of land that we promised South Africa in 1926, and it may be time to be done with their claims and disputes."

southafrica.33.t:0 "Transfer of North Rhodesia"
southafrica.33.d:0 "North Rhodesia has been transferred to South African control! Celebrations lasted long into the night in the capital and Jan Smuts delivered a passionate and emotional speech declaring his dream of a Greater South Africa fulfilled. While there are other territorial claims that our nation can continue to pursue, no outside observer can now doubt that we are the greatest nation on the continent, and easily the greatest testament to the autonomy and independence of the dominions.

We could, of course, agree to sell the southeast African colony, though it does continue to be a valuable site for trade, naval bases, and resources - largely oil. Selling the colony may also weaken our position in the world further, as it is the second-largest territory we currently possess, and would further strengthen a rival British dominion..."

southafrica.36.t:0 "Portugal Declines our Offer"
southafrica.36.d:0 "The Portuguese government responeded to our offer to buy Mozambique today, saying that the colony is not for sale. While Mozambique would have given us valuable ports on the Indian Ocean and much-needed reserves of oil, it also would have posed a challenge to administrate such a large area that speaks a completely separate language. It appears that we will simply have to make do without it."

southafrica.37.t:0 "South Africa Occupies the High Commissioner Territories"
southafrica.37.d:0 "Reports came in today from southern Africa, where our High Commissioner Territories of Basutoland and Swaziland were invaded and suddenly occupied by South African forces this morning. South Africa recently declared independence from our Empire and rule, so their move is technically a violation of peace and international law. At the same time, those colonies were of little use to us, and we have not yet recognized South African independence. It may be best for us to just bide our time, and if they try to strike again, strike them back."

southafrica.38.t:0 "Our Occupation of the High Commissioner Territories is Successful!"
southafrica.38.d:0 "While some in our government feared that the Empire might retaliate to our occupation of their territories with force, London has remained silent on the matter. Today the British Foreign Minister even released a statement saying that the Empire had decided to 'transfer' the territories to us. Clearly they are afraid, and do not wish to fight a war against us! Let this be a lesson to the world that the British Empire is weak, and if properly exploited, can fall!"

Small skirmishes broke out between South African and Imperial forces, and the South African government has released a statement declaring that they intend to occupy the land that we promised the former dominion in 1926. We must make a decision now on whether to withdraw and let them take the land or stand up to them and fight back. If we withdraw, we risk losing valuable resources alongside international prestige. But if we go to war, there's no telling how many lives another war against the Boers could take..."

The new coalition has taken advantage of this, and all three parties heavily favor increased ties with the United Kingdom alongside liberal policies of de-segregation and cultural reconciliation. They are even running non-white candidates in a number of constituencies. Boer and Nationalist politicians alike have lambasted these plans as 'radical' and 'destructive for the nation,' and have fumed at the United Kingdom for overturning their law. For now, we can only hope that this doesn't cause too much more chaos in an already chaotic election."

Later, promises were expanded to include Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. For years, South African politicians have obsessed over taking these lands, claiming that they are owed to us by the treaty. This has gone on for so long that it has distracted the government from matters of actual concern, among them the issues of segregation and injustice prevalent in our society. By relinquishing our claims on these colonies, we show the world that we are ready to move on, and ready to make ourselves a better state rather than a bigger one."

Free to pursue its own desires, the Union of South Africa has one ultimate and inevitable destiny; to reshape Africa in its own vision. \n\nFor too long, European powers have settled colonies in Africa and capitalized upon those settlers without a single care for them. Today, that attitude's end nears. The strongest will always rule what they take, and it is our destiny to take the lands that they have turned a blind to for far too long. Some across the world call us uhninged, or delusional. But it is only an attempt to hide their true emotion; fear.

In West Africa, Natives and opportunistic settlers have long stirred anti-French resentment in the hopes of someday mounting a successful series of revolts. Some members of the Cabinet have suggested that funding rebels in these areas, as well as others, could give us the upper hand when war inevitably breaks out between us and Europe. Others in government say we should only sponsor settler rebels, and yet others say we should not sponsor any at all, and that revolutionaries often bite the hand that feeds them."

South Africa, should we allow them in, would grant us a location of strategic significance against British colonies in Africa. Many in our government are supportive of accepting the nation, while some are more hesitant, preferring to keep the alliance European-based. It must also be noted that the current South African governing coalition includes 'Valkists,' though they are Valkist in name only.

For years, South African leaders have called for a Greater South Africa - as if the acquisition of land alone would make the nation great. While we have addressed those outstanding claims to territorial expansion, we have also addressed the international community's view of us. Today, our standing among the rest of the world is better than ever. Today, we have crafted for ourselves a new beginning; a fresh start to what is essentially a new nation.

He is a non-offensive choice sure to be effective. A.B. Xuma, by contrast, is a true liberal. Leader of the ANC Party, he would be the nation's first leader of color, which would surely bring the Boers to near-arms if chosen. Yet should this not be the message we send to the rest of the world? And finally, there is William Andrews, the leader of the Labour Party. Andrews is a strong advocate for labor unions and liberal work reform, but is unabashedly racist, and could cause further division in our ranks. \n\nWhichever man we choose will lead us through trying times ahead, so we must make our choice carefully and wisely."
southafrica.81.a:0 "A.B. Xuma will represent a new generation of leadership!"
southafrica.81.b:0 "William Andrews will connect us with the comman man!"
southafrica.81.c:0 "Charles Stallard is the common sense choice."

southafrica.82.t:0 "The Next Prime Minister"
southafrica.82.d:0 "With the Union Party being re-elected with a majority in the House of Assembly, it finds itself struggling to determine who will serve as the nation's Prime Minister for the next term. J.B.M. Hertzog has served for several terms now, and Jan Smuts has been all but jumping at the opportunity to serve in the position. Yet whoever holds the Prime Ministership will represent our country in all affairs domestic and foreign, so we must choose carefully and wisely."
southafrica.82.a:0 "Hertzog will remain Prime Minister."
southafrica.82.b:0 "It's time to hand the position over to Smuts."

southafrica.83.t:0 "The New Prime Minister"
southafrica.83.d:0 "Now that the nationalist coalition between the PNP, Sentrale, and OB Parties has assumed power in Pretoria, the time has come to choose the nation's new Prime Minister. Two men have put their names forward; Tielman Roos and D.F. Malan. \n\nRoos has led a breakaway party for several years now, and has demonstrated an uncanny ability to lead around a cult of personality. If chosen, he is sure to be effective, though he may take away from our grand vision. Malan, on the other hand, has been the architect behind our victory, and has long planned for the future we will now strive to create. He would be the obvious, if offensive, choice. Whichever man we choose will lead our country through trying times ahead, so we must make our choice carefully and wisely."
southafrica.83.a:0 "D.F. Malan will lead us into a new future."
southafrica.83.b:0 "Tielman Roos should have the position."


southafrica.85.t:0 "A Storm is Brewing"
southafrica.85.d:0 "The country is quiet. Too quiet. Today, nationalist politicians left the capital en masse. The usually-boisterous Boer militias in the countryside have gone silent. We still go day after day passing reform after reform, but now there is no more protest or complaint. Only silence. Some are speculating that the tensions that have been building for years between the Empire and the Boers - between right and wrong, good and evil - are about to break, and civil war will engulf South Africa once more. Yet others say the Boers are just retreating, and that we have finally beaten them at their own game. Regardless, we shall continue to pass reforms and make South Africa a better place...no matter the cost."
southafrica.85.a:0 "Something isn't right..."


southafrica.90.t:0 "Integration Legislated"
southafrica.90.d:0 "The new government has not stalled in passing a series of new laws and reforms, touching every aspect of South African life and economy. Today, the House of Assembly passed - along a mostly party-line vote - an extensive package of bills designed to legislate the integration of native Africans into society. Before now, under the rule of various nationalist politicians, natives had been scapegoated for all of the nation's woes, and subsequently discriminated against through various legal and immoral methods. Over the next five years, this new series of laws will gradually dissolve the apparatus of segregation and apartheid and grant social equality and freedom to all native Africans. While nationalists - wed as they are to the old ways - have been screaming and shouting in the halls of the House, the simple truth of the matter is that their days of racism and inequality are over, and a new golden era for South Africa is just beginning."
southafrica.90.a:0 "South Africa will start anew."
southafrica.90.b:0 "South Africa must start anew."

southafrica.91.t:0 "Autonomy for the Transvaal"
southafrica.91.d:0 "Today, the United government of South Africa passed a package of bills designed to grant increased autonomy to the Transvaal Province. While some politicians from the ANC coalition protested against the bills, most voted in their favor when they were finally put to a floor vote in the House of Assembly. Among other things, the bills will allow the Transvaal to organize its own parliament, enact is own local laws, and hold itself to a somewhat different standard than the rest of the country. While the move is not ideal to those who hoped to form a tighter and more centralized Union, even the Prime Minister has acknowledged that the steps are necessary to quell Boer unrest in the countryside and begin returning the country to some form of normalcy. By granting autonomy - which is largely superficial to begin with - we are effectively avoiding the potential for another Boer War, and paving the way to begin getting the real business of government done."
southafrica.91.a:0 "Let us have peace."

southafrica.92.t:0 "Our New Constitution"
southafrica.92.d:0 "The nationalist government of South Africa has today passed a new constitution to govern the nation. It was passed by the House of Assembly without a single non-coalition vote, and while the United Kingdom will refuse to recognize its legitimacy, it will become the de facto law of the land for the Union. In writing this new constitution, however, some internal debate within the coalition has threatened its proper implementation and recognition. Some in the coalition - largely the Valkists - are pushing for clauses to be included which would solidify our stability and strive to create a stable and lasting system. Others from the Purified National Party, by contrast, are pushing for clauses which would ensure continued nationalist rule for the foreseeable future. No matter which clauses are adopted, the coalition risks fracturing, though that remains highly unlikely."
southafrica.92.a:0 "We shall focus on building our own power."
southafrica.92.b:0 "We shall focus on building a lasting society."


southafrica.94.t:0 "Riots in Cape Town"
southafrica.94.d:0 "Last night, in response to the enshrinement of segregation as law, riots broke out across Cape Town. Men and women of native descent, alongside those of white settler ancestry as well, vandalized shopfronts, stormed government buildings, and fired weapons at police forces. Some reports have even indicated unrest and uncertainty from within the city's police force as well. Some in the government are calling for an immediate occupation of the city with a contingent of the army - something which would strain our military in its greatest time of need. Yet if we allow the riots to continue, they will undoubtebly take a toll on our legitimacy as a government, and weaken our domestic standing at the worst possible moment."
southafrica.94.a:0 "Send in the army and occupy the city."
southafrica.94.b:0 "Let the riots run their course."

southafrica.95.t:0 "Recovery from the Revolt - Rebuilding Our Industry"
southafrica.95.d:0 "With our long war against the Boer nationalists finally over, we must begin to rebuild our nation from the damage it has suffered. We must prioritize our industry first; without it, we will be unable to resupply our armies or keep the people at peace. By nationalizing the industries of South Africa, we will be able to quickly and efficiently rebuild without waiting for the free market to fix our country for us. Many in the government already support such a move, and are just waiting for a bill to be put to the floor for a vote."
southafrica.95.a:0 "Slowly but surely, we will rebuild."

southafrica.96.t:0 "Recovery from the Revolt - Rebuilding Our Army"
southafrica.96.d:0 "The scars from our recent war against the Boers still show most prominently in our army. We lost many men in the conflict, and we must resupply and reorganize our soldiers if we are to keep the peace in the near future. Several bills have already been proposed to do such a thing, and with our industry slowly on its way to recovering to pre-conflict levels, we now find ourselves obligated to turn our investment and resources to our defense."
southafrica.96.a:0 "Recovery is a long process."

southafrica.97.t:0 "Recovery from the Revolt - Rebuilding Our Government"
southafrica.97.d:0 "The institution that took the most damage from the Boer revolt was our government. Citizens openly question its legitimacy and its ability to defend the nation, and much of the United members of the House of Assembly may resign in the coming days, once our industry and army have mostly recovered to pre-conflict levels. In order to restore public confidence in the system - and in order to ensure we create a structure that will maintain peace for the foreseeable future - a full-scale reform of our government is in order. From reforming our electoral system to moving further away from British infuence, no options are off the table. With these final reforms, we will finally crest the peak of the long road to recovery, and begin our rebirth as a nation."
southafrica.97.a:0 "Let us heal from our old wounds, and begin anew."

southafrica.98.t:0 "Referendum in Rhodesia"
southafrica.98.d:0 "Today, voters headed to the polls in Rhodesia to vote on whether or not to become a colony independent from South Africa under the rule of the British Empire. With most results counted, it has become apparent that Rhodesia has chosen to remain part of our Union. Many in the House of Assembly are attributing this result to the aid offered by our government when the region was struck by recent economic protests, and representatives from the Province are already working with representatives of our government to try to continue alleviating the issues that the region faces. Today, however, we can breathe a sigh of relief that the Union will not fracture."
southafrica.98.a:0 "The Union stands strong!"

southafrica.99.t:0 "Referendum in Rhodesia"
southafrica.99.d:0 "Today, voters headed to the polls in Rhodesia to vote on whether or not to become a colony independent from South Africa under the rule of the British Empire. With most results counted, it has become apparent that Rhodesia has chosen to leave our Union. Many in the House of Assembly are attributing this result to the military crackdown inflicted by our government when the region was struck by recent economic protests, and representatives from the Province are already working with representatives of Parliament and our government to ensure a smooth transition into nationhood."
southafrica.99.a:0 "Grant them the independence they so desire."
southafrica.99.b:0 "We are finally free!"

southafrica.100.t:0 "The Fourth Boer War"
southafrica.100.d:0 "Since the ANC coalition took power and began to institute much-needed reforms, South Africa has seemed more volatile than ever before. While some politicians and voters have expressed support for extending equality and integration to the entire country, some groups continue to resist. Most angry of all are the Boers.\n\nSince the end of the Third Boer War during the Great War, South Africa has lived in relative peace and harmony. While the fighting was brutal, many believed a certain degree of reconciliation was taking place in the country. To suggest so today however, one would only be met with derision.\n\nThe Boers - for the fourth time in less than sixty years - have risen the standard of rebellion against the Empire. Unwilling to allow their autonomy be taken from them in the ANC's sweeping reforms, the Boers have already succeeded in raiding many arms depots throughout South Africa and have captured a large swathe of territory in their wake. More worringly, some military units of South Africa have defected to the Boer side. It seems that this Boer War may be bloodier than any before it."

southafrica.101.d:0 "Since the United Kingdom announced its intentions to consolidate all of its colonies and Dominions into a single, Imperial Federation, South Africa has seemed more volatile than ever before. While politicians in the United Party have attempted to settle some of the unrest, some groups continue to resist.

southafrica.102.t:0 "The Fate of East Africa"
southafrica.102.d:0 "With the former German colony of Tanganyika under our control, we now have an opportunity to set up a state of our own in eastern Africa, incorporating several other British colonies we have captured or plan to capture around it. Such an East African state has long been a dream of several visionary politicians who would no doubt jump at the opportunity to lead it. Others say we should administrate the land directly, and bring all of Africa under our rule. What shall we do with the conquered territory?"

We will administer the Suez Canal ourselves whether or not we create the state, but releasing Egypt may be useful in further fielding support in our quest for independence from Imperialism. At the same time, some believe we should retain direct control over the land for better access to its resources. What shall we do with the conquered territory?"

southafrica.105.d:0 "With Abyssinia now firmly under our control, we have an opportunity to set up a state of our own, incorporating colonies in Somalia and Eritrea that we have captured or plan to capture. The state and its people will be subservient to us whether or not we create it, but releasing Abyssinia under a settler administration may be useful in further fielding support for our vision of African colonies that can govern themselves. At the same time, some believe we should retain direct control over the land for better access to its resources. What shall we do with the conquered territory?"

southafrica.109.d:0 "With our war against the Boers still going strong, reports are now reaching us of armed militias of German symphathizers in the Kalahari Territory! We don't know what promises the Boer 'government' has made them, but they are now raiding our armories and supply stores in the west and declaring support for the rest of the rebels in the country. An already complicated situation has been made even worse."

Many rebel leaders have begun to call for the reconstruction of a South African state - under nationalist control, of course. While it may be tempting to keep the lands outside of the Transvaal in complete anarchy, we will get nowhere with our accomplishments without reforming an independent South Africa."
