#### Events ####

afghan.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Afghanistan"
afghan.0.d:0 "The history of Afghanistan goes back many thousands of years, with both the Islamic and the Mongol conquests, the dynasty of the Hotak, and the Durrani Empire. At the start of the 20th century, the country was ruled as an emirate under emir Habibullah Khan, that managed to survive as, at least somewhat, independent from the British and Russian empires.\n\nThe emir was assassinated during the Great War, with his son, Amanullah Khan, becoming emir. While continuing the progressive reforms of his father, Amanullah also took Afghanistan to war with the British. The war would eventually end in a status quo. While modernizing the country, Amanullah would also see a loss in popularity. The tajik Habibullāh Kalakāni's uprising would be the end of Amanullah's reign.\n\nIn 1929, Mohammed Nadir Khan became the new king of Afghanistan. His reign would see the end of some of Amanullah's reforms, while still keeping some semblance of constitutionalism. But the popularity of the king has been faltering, and support for Amanullah Khan or Habibullāh Kalakāni is still present. New ideas of Republicanism and Socialism have also begun to sneak into Afghanistan."
afghan.0.a:0 "Less Talk, More Action"

afghan.1.t:0 "India in Rebellion"
afghan.1.d:0 "Our neighbours, the people of the Indian subcontinent, are in open revolt against the British Empire. This revolt, with its magnitude, is one that can reveal the cracks in British hegemony. This might be the time to strike and take back what the Durrani Empire lost in the 19th century. But there are also some advisors that give warnings against making such an aggressive move. They argue that the British can strike back and defeat us. It is up to the king and his government what our stance should be."
afghan.1.a:0 "Prime Time for Intervention!"
afghan.1.b:0 "No, It Will Just Trigger a Bigger Conflict"

afghan.2.t:0 "Afghanistan Siezes the North-West Frontier"
afghan.2.d:0 "The Afghan army has siezed the opportunity to make gains from the conflict now raging in India. Their army has now marched into the North-West Frontier Province, along with other territories in the area. While the aggression should not be tolerated, it is not in our position right now to fight them back."
afghan.2.a:0 "They Will Eventually Regret It"

afghan.3.t:0 "Afghanistan Siezes the North-West Frontier"
afghan.3.d:0 "The Afghan army has siezed the opportunity to make gains from the conflict now raging in India. Their army has now marched into the North-West Frontier Province, along with other territories in the area. This aggression can not be tolerated. We can either take the initiative to launch an attack, or consult with London on what we should do."
afghan.3.a:0 "Lead an Attack!"
afghan.3.b:0 "Best to Hear From London.."

afghan.4.t:0 "Afghan Aggression"
afghan.4.d:0 "News from our possessions in India have told us that the Afghan army has siezed the North-West Frontier. This news is a disturbance, and our colonial friends are asking us what the Empire intends to do with this."
afghan.4.a:0 "Like the Indian Rebels, Afghanistan Will be Crushed!"
afghan.4.b:0 "We Will Deal With Them Later"

afghan.5.t:0 "Afghanistan Repells Us From Quetta"
afghan.5.d:0 "Our army have been repelled from Quetta and have not managed to take back the North-West Frontier. Our advisors argue that we should make peace with the Afghans and strike at them at a later date."
afghan.5.a:0 "Yeah, Let's Get Some Peace"
afghan.5.b:0 "No! The War Continues!"

afghan.6.t:0 "The British Want Peace"
afghan.6.d:0 "We have managed to get the British to the negotiation table. They have let us take their North-West Frontier, while also aquiring Quetta. Certainly, this is a great victory!"
afghan.6.a:0 "Long Live Afghanistan!"

afghan.7.t:0 "Conflict Between British India and Afghanistan"
afghan.7.d:0 "With the Indian rebellion already ravaging the region, a new conflict has arisen in India. This time, it is the Afghans attempting to sieze land from the Raj. Our colonial friends in India have already decleared war, which leaves us little choice but to join in."
afghan.7.a:0 "Next Time, You Ask Us, India"

afghan.8.t:0 "The Afghans Have Been Pushed Back"
afghan.8.d:0 "The British Empire has been victorious in its war against the Afghans. With the rouge kingdom being defeated in the North-West Frontier, it is time to send them our ultimatum."
afghan.8.a:0 "Send Them the Peace Offer!"
afghan.8.b:0 "No, We Must Crush Them!"

afghan.9.t:0 "Peace Offer From the British"
afghan.9.d:0 "We have recieved a telegram from the British leadership, offering us peace. With our kingdom loosing our recent conquest in this conflict, it might be smart to accept the peace so as not to lose any more land."
afghan.9.a:0 "We Have to Accept It"
afghan.9.b:0 "It's Victory or Death! No Middle Ground!"

afghan.10.t:0 "The Assassination of Muhammad Nadir Khan"
afghan.10.d:0 "Muhammad Nadir Khan, the king of Afghanistan has today been shot dead while visiting a new school in Ghazni. The assassin has been identified as a Hazara student of the school. This event has shocked the whole country, with loyalists ready to avenge the fallen monarch. Some might see the situation as the end of the dynasty. Others sees it as the time to act against Socialists, Republicans, Hazaras, and contenders for the throne."
afghan.10.a:0 "The King is Dead..."

afghan.11.t:0 "Weekh Zalmian Mobilizes"
afghan.11.d:0 "With the instability caused by the death of the king, the pro-reformist, semi-socialist group Weekh Zalmian has begun to mobilize. They are opposed to the monarchy, seeing it as a conservative institution opposed to reforms, and as an oppressive force over the workers and the people. While they say that they want a democratic republic, the group is also quite influenced by the Soviet Union. These ties might make them dangerous to the Afghan Kingdom."
afghan.11.a:0 "Dangerous Indeed"

afghan.12.t:0 "Habibullāh Kalakāni Seen in the North"
afghan.12.d:0 "The traitorous Habibullāh Kalakāni is now reported to have been seen in the northern parts of Afghanistan. He seems to have managed to return from exile, following the assassination of the king. His presence alone has managed to grow his popularity, and he has gained a substantial number of followers. It seems like they have managed to organize into a pro-Kalakāni group called the Saqqawists. The conservative message of Kalakāni has managed to get support from many that are afraid of the way Afghanistan might develop itself in the future."
afghan.12.a:0 "The Return of the Tajik"

afghan.13.t:0 "Amanullah Khan Gains Support"
afghan.13.d:0 "Former king Amanullah Khan is still highly respected, with a following of his own, in Afghanistan. With the assassination of, what might be, the sole obstacle to Amanullah making a comeback, his popularity has naturally seen a new rise. There are even rumors of some supporters of his within the royal court. Rumors that there are some who want to overthrow the Musahibans, in favor of Amanullah Khan."
afghan.13.a:0 "Better Watch Out"

afghan.14.t:0 "Execution of the Hazara"
afghan.14.d:0 "Today, the execution of the Hazara student that assassinated the king, along with many of his friends and family, has taken place. With the removal of these people now complete, there are still many in the court with a taste for further revenge. Prominent officers, seemingly with a Pashtun nationalist outlook, have been eager to turn our wrath against the Hazara population of Afghanistan. While there are many arguing against it, doing so may take out potential enemies to the state in the process."
afghan.14.a:0 "There Have Been Enough Deaths Already!"
afghan.14.b:0 "We Need to Eradicate This Threat!"

afghan.15.t:0 "The Coronation of Mohammed Zahir Khan"
afghan.15.d:0 "With peace settling down after the assassination of king Mohammed Nadir Khan, it is finally time to crown his heir and successor, Mohammed Zahir. While the young king is only 22 years old, with the support of his uncles, his reign will be secured. A hope for a prosperous country is present. Still, there is some opposition to the king, but this will be easily taken care of."
afghan.15.a:0 "...Long Live the King!"

afghan.16.t:0 "The New King Seeks a Tour of Afghanistan"
afghan.16.d:0 "King Mohammed Zahir Khan has showed interest in touring the country, to see what he is ruling over. While this is a possibility for a morale boost, some reports have said it is dangerous with supporters for both Amanullah Khan and Habibullāh Kalakāni still in hiding. Republicans might also pose a threat to the new king."
afghan.16.a:0 "Touring Can be Done Later"
afghan.16.b:0 "Afghanistan Needs to See Their King"

afghan.17.t:0 "The Death of the New King"
afghan.17.d:0 "It is terrible! King Mohammed Zahir Khan and his company was attacked on his tour of the country. It is said that the attackers were either Republicans or Kalakāni loyalists. Regardless of who was responsible, the report says that the king was shot dead, while most of his company was slaughtered or scattered. This has made the situation too unstable, and it might mean the end of the Kingdom as it is known."
afghan.17.a:0 "This Can't Be!"

afghan.18.t:0 "The People Storm the Palace"
afghan.18.d:0 "Fueled by both the death of King Mohammed Nadir and King Mohammed Zahir, the people of Kabul are now storming the palace. Units from the Afghan Army have been seen deserting to the revolt, or fleeing from the capital. This might be the end for the Kingdom. But there is still one way for it to survive. Military officers have urged the remaining Government officials to contact Amanullah Khan's loyalists. But this will also mean the end of the Musahibans' hold on power."
afghan.18.a:0 "The Lion is Defeated by the Sheep!"
afghan.18.b:0 "Contact Amanullah's Loyalists!"

afghan.19.t:0 "The Revolution Succeeds!"
afghan.19.d:0 "The people of Afghanistan have victoriously defeated the reactionary monarchy, freeing the workers and the people from the oppressive rule of the old kings. With the monarchists either imprisoned, killed, or fleeing from our advancing forces, the Revolution is secured at last. Long Live the Revolution!"
afghan.19.a:0 "Long Live Afghanistan!"

afghan.20.t:0 "Amanullah Loyalists Seize Kabul"
afghan.20.d:0 "With remaining loyalists to the dead king united with the loyalists of Amanullah Khan, the Revolution has been put down. While this is a loss for the Musahibans, the kingdom is still standing. Following this, King Amanullah Khan has agreed to return to Afghanistan from exile to be crowned king. This will be the start of a new era, indeed."
afghan.20.a:0 "...Long Live the King!"

afghan.21.t:0 "Kalakāni's Uprising in the North"
afghan.21.d:0 "The tajik bandit Habibullāh Kalakāni has taken up arms against the Republic, seeing us as a threat to Islam and the traditions of Afghanistan! He has managed to gain support among the Tajik population, and even among some of the Pashtun tribes still existing outside of Kabul. It will soon be up to us to eradicate this threat."
afghan.21.a:0 "The Revolution Can Not be Stopped!"

afghan.22.t:0 "Advancing on the Saqqawists"
afghan.22.d:0 "We have planned out possible ways to defeat the tajik bandit and his supporters in battle. Many of our officers suggest a fast advance into the north, crushing the uprising quickly and decisively. But there are also many officers that remain skeptical, saying that a controlled advance is better. It is up to us what plans we will execute."
afghan.22.a:0 "A Controlled Advance!"
afghan.22.b:0 "A Lighting Advance!"

afghan.23.t:0 "Victory at Baghlan"
afghan.23.d:0 "With a controlled advance into the North, we have been able to keep our forces organized and well supplied. At the town of Baghlan, our forces met the forces of Habibullāh Kalakāni and other anti-republican forces. While they were relatively organized and entrenched, their numbers was not as high as ours. With modern Russian weapons, we were able to crush them and take Kalakāni captive."
afghan.23.a:0 "A True Victory for the Revolution!"

afghan.24.t:0 "The Ambush at Taloqan"
afghan.24.d:0 "Our forces have taken a fast advance into the North. At first, it looked like it would be a successful campaign. But when our forces reached the town of Taloqan, they were cut off and ambushed by Habibullāh Kalakāni and other anti-republican forces. This is a heavy loss, with few soldiers returning from the campaign. This might even mean the end of the Revolution."
afghan.24.a:0 "What Idiot Suggested That Plan!"

afghan.25.t:0 "The Anti-Republican Forces Reach Kabul"
afghan.25.d:0 "Habibullāh Kalakāni and other anti-republican forces have managed to reach the capital city of Kabul. With little resources left, this might be the end of the Revolution. At least we will give them everything we have."
afghan.25.a:0 "For the Revolution!"

afghan.26.t:0 "The Capture of Kabul"
afghan.26.d:0 "The Revolution has been put down. This is a great victory for the Kingdom of Afghanistan. But with the fall of the Republicans, old allies have become new enemies. Supporters of Habibullāh Kalakāni and supporters of the old monarchy are now in a game to see who can secure power and oust the other faction."
afghan.26.a:0 "The Pashtuns Secure Power for Amanullah"
afghan.26.b:0 "The Tajiks Secure Power for Kalakāni"

afghan.27.t:0 "The Execution of Kalakāni"
afghan.27.d:0 "With Kalakāni as our captive, we finally have the opportunity to shoot this enemy of the Revolution once and for all. This will also be a stand against the backward banditry of the old order, such as those that Habibullāh Kalakāni represents. His death will mean the end for his movement and the uprising he has led."
afghan.27.a:0 "Fire!"

afghan.28.t:0 "The Soviet Question"
afghan.28.d:0 "With internal troubles taken care off, it is finally time to set sight on what this Revolution is supposed to accomplish. Modernization, progressive reforms, and social welfare are all things that most in the Weekh Zalmian want, but there are other things where there are opposing voices.\n\nThe question about our stance when it comes to the Soviet Union and Socialism have many in the movement split. Nur Muhammad Taraki, one of the most powerful leaders of the movement, has made a strong case for Soviet alignment and Socialism. Gul Pacha Ulfat, an influencial author in the movement, has made a case against Soviet alignment. It is clear that this question will decide the future of the Revolution."
afghan.28.a:0 "The Soviets are our Revolutionary Friends!"
afghan.28.b:0 "The Soviets are as Dangerous to Democracy as the Monarchy!"

afghan.29.t:0 "A Socialist Revolution"
afghan.29.d:0 "The Weekh Zalmian has today declared the Revolution a socialist one. In addition, the movement has also aligned Afghanistan much closer to the Soviet Union. With this, Nur Muhammad Taraki has been declared the General Secretary of the Weekh Zalmian, effectivly making him the leader of Afghanistan."
afghan.29.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"

afghan.30.t:0 "A Democratic Revolution"
afghan.30.d:0 "The Weekh Zalmian has today declared the Revolution a democratic one. In addition, the movement has also denounced the Soviet Union for their continuous one-party rule. With this, Gul Pacha Ulfat has been declared the First President of the Afghan Republic, making him the new leader of the Weekh Zalmian."
afghan.30.a:0 "Long Live the Afghan Republic!"

afghan.31.t:0 "Uprisings in Hazarajat"
afghan.31.d:0 "Our campaign to end the threat that the Hazaras pose has not been easy. Hazara tribes have taken up arms against us and what they call a 'violent pacification of their communities'. Even if we become more conservative in our operations, it seems like the uprising will not die down."
afghan.31.a:0 "Oh Crap.."

afghan.32.t:0 "Tajiks in the North Flock to Kalakāni"
afghan.32.d:0 "With an uprising taking place among the Hazara tribes in Hazarajat, the rumor that the government will pursue violent pacification of the Tajiks has made some Tajiks in Northern Afghanistan turn against us. They are flocking to the tajik bandit Habibullāh Kalakāni, seeing him as a better option than our own government."
afghan.32.a:0 "This is Not Good"

afghan.33.t:0 "Riots in Kabul"
afghan.33.d:0 "Riots have broken out among the population in and around Kabul. While many of the richer areas of Kabul are supportive of our campaigns against the Hazaras, there are those that are disgusted by our actions. With the rioters standing in front of the Royal Palace, some commanders urge us to give the order to fire. But there are also those among them that discourage so extreme an action."
afghan.33.a:0 "Just Secure the Peace"
afghan.33.b:0 "Fire!"

afghan.34.t:0 "The Riots End"
afghan.34.d:0 "The riots in Kabul seem to be withering away. With the government already halting attempted eradications of Hazara communities, many rioters are finding themselves content. It also looks like we have been able to keep the peace in the North, pushing Kalakāni either underground or out of Afghanistan. We don't really know. It seems like it might be the time to pass the throne on."
afghan.34.a:0 "Good News at Least"

afghan.35.t:0 "The Soldiers Turn on Their Superiors"
afghan.35.d:0 "Our order to fire at the rioters was not happily recieved by our soldiers. They was rather uneasy, with many of them refusing to take the lives of people that they might even be related to. After the order was given a third or fourth time, some fired, while most of them turned their weapons against their superiors. After some time, the soldiers had either fled or turned against our government."
afghan.35.a:0 "Those Traitors!"

afghan.36.d:0 "Fueled by the death of King Mohammed Nadir and our attempted eradication of Hazara communities, the people of Kabul are now storming the palace. Units from the Afghan Army have in turn deserted to the revolt, or fled from the capital. This might be the end for the Kingdom. But there is still one way for it to survive. Military officers have urged the remaining Government officials to contact Amanullah Khan's loyalists. But this will also mean that Mohammed Zahir will not get the chance to be king."
afghan.36.a:0 "The Lion is Defeated by the Sheep!"
afghan.36.b:0 "Contact Amanullah's Loyalists!"

afghan.37.t:0 "The State of the Kingdom"
afghan.37.d:0 "Mohammed Zahir Khan, the new King of Afghanistan, has managed to secure his reign. With opposition pacified for now, the King and his ministers are looking inward in order to improve the state of Afghanistan. Some ministers have proposed a plan to modernize and reform the Kingdom, building up its infrastructure and industrial potential. This is, however, challenged by the more conservative ministers. The conservatives argue that Afghanistan should keep to the policies of the previous king, Mohammed Nadir Khan."
afghan.37.a:0 "Afghanistan Needs to Modernize!"
afghan.37.b:0 "Let's Stick to Tradition!"

afghan.38.t:0 "Amanullah's Reforms"
afghan.38.d:0 "Amanullah Khan, the new King of Afghanistan, now holds control over the country. With opposition pacified for now, Amanullah has begun to look inward. Together with his loyal followers and ministers, he has announced sweeping reforms in the Kingdom of Afghanistan. Along with the promise of more rights and freedoms, Amanullah has also promised a modernization of the country's infrastructure and industry."
afghan.38.a:0 "Forward For Progress!"

afghan.39.t:0 "The Revolution Continues"
afghan.39.d:0 "With the enemies of the Republican Revolution taken care of, it is finally time for us to look inward. The country of Afghanistan has through its history been a backward state, held back by the old Kings and their ministers. But now, as a Republic, Afghanistan needs to modernize and become a part of the 20th century. This will be some of the final steps in our Revolution, and will finally free us from a reactionary society."
afghan.39.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"

afghan.40.t:0 "An Overture For Tradition"
afghan.40.d:0 "The new reign of King Habibullāh Kalakāni is finally safe from the enemies of the state. With the state secured, it is time for Afghanistan to move forward, not in the direction of wicked modernization, but towards tradition and agriculture. This lies perfectly with Kalakāni's goal to Defend Islam, Defend Afghanistan and, in return, Defend his own power."
afghan.40.a:0 "Afghanistan Will Stay True!"

## Focus Events ##

afghan.100.t:0 "The Fate of the Constitutional Monarchy"
afghan.100.d:0 "Afghanistan is, on paper, a constitutional monarchy. Even if the King and his Government have more power than the Loya Jirga, they are still somewhat limited in what they can do. Some Government officials argue that the Loya Jirga should be reversed back to its old role; an assembly called on only when the King needed it to be present. But with the advances already made, it would be hard to do this without opposition."
afghan.100.a:0 "So Long As We Control Them, They Can Exist"
afghan.100.b:0 "Their Presence Is Not Needed Anymore"

afghan.101.t:0 "The Trial of the Musahibans"
afghan.101.d:0 "The Musahiban brothers, King Mohammed Nadir Khan and his siblings, have held power in Afghanistan for years. Now that they are defeated and the true king of Afghanistan holds onto power, it is time to take these traitors to trial. With them taken care of, Afghanistan will finally be free from their grasp."
afghan.101.a:0 "Their Punishment Will be Severe"

afghan.102.t:0 "Loyalty Among the Pashtun Tribes"
afghan.102.d:0 "Our government has managed to negotiate with the Pashtun Tribes, assuring their loyalty to Afghanistan. While we have had to give them concessions, the rewards for this is a more stable and stronger rule. So long we are able to keep them loyal, they will not oppose our governance."
afghan.102.a:0 "Together, We Can Make Afghanistan Great"

afghan.103.t:0 "Tribal Influences Curbed"
afghan.103.d:0 "While we have made many an enemy among the Pashtun and Hazara tribes, our efforts to curb their influence will be needed to set the lower classes of Afghanistan free from oppression. It would also be strange if a revolution would not bring just changes to society, such as curbing the influences of said tribes."
afghan.103.a:0 "Long Live Social Justice!"

afghan.104.t:0 "Weaker Tribal Influences"
afghan.104.d:0 "The influence held by the tribes in Afghanistan has successfully been weakened. With tribal members adopting the ideal that the tribe is an ancient idea, not compatible with the idea of the new Afghan nation, the Pashtun and Hazara tribes have lost some of their power in our society. Together, we will build an Afghan society under God."
afghan.104.a:0 "Only God Above Afghanistan!"

afghan.105.t:0 "The Case About Aggressive Religions"
afghan.105.d:0 "In recent years, Islam's role in Afghanistan has been challenged by outside influences and religions. With the Russian and British empires, Christianity was introduced to our homeland, and from the Indian subcontinent, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism have spread widely. With the revolutions in Russia, secular and atheist influences became a new aggressor. Some of these faiths might be able to integrate into an Islamic society, but there is an argument that nonbelievers should not be tolerated at all, in accordance with the Quran."
afghan.105.a:0 "'Fight the Nonbelievers! Let Them Find Harshness!'"
afghan.105.b:0 "So Long They Accept Islam, They Can Stay"

afghan.106.t:0 "A Raid Into Central Asia"
afghan.106.d:0 "With our power secured, we have finally taken the steps to raid our neighbours, in order to enrich ourselves. Led by King Habibullāh Kalakāni, a party of armed men rode over the border into Central Asia. Now, the King's band has returned, carrying riches and glory back with them. This is indeed going to be the new norm for the Afghan monarch."
afghan.106.a:0 "Hurrah! Hurrah!"

AFG_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Afghanistan has a long history, with both conquests and many dynasties ruling its land. After the Great War, Afghanistan saw the rule of their progressive monarch, Amanullah Khan, fall apart under an uprising by the tajik Habibullāh Kalakāni. In 1929, however, the Musahibans would seize power under the reign of Mohammed Nadir Khan. Since then, the Kingdom has been ruled with relative peace. But both Amanullah Khan and Kalakāni are still at large, and with the rise of ideas like Nationalism, Socialism, and Republicanism in Afghanistan, one spark might light a fire, and change the country forever."
