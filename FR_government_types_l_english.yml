 gov.1.t:0 "The Breakdown of the [Root.GetName]"

With the [Root.GetAdjective] government unable to to perform the actions and duties expected of it many of our people have begun to look towards the black market and other such illegal organizations to satisfy their needs. In light of our government's public weakness political agitators ranging from labor organizations to opposition parties have begun to hold protests and question our administration's legitimacy. If it wasn't for the loyalty of the [Root.GetAdjective] army many fear that the [Root.GetName] may collapse into a civil war. If we are to reverse this impending disaster we must implement major reforms to improve our country's internal stability."
