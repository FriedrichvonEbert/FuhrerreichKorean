ENG_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "대전쟁은 5년간의 무자비한 학살과 파괴를 불러왔습니다. 결국 영국은 지금은 갈갈이 찢겨진 동맹국에게서 승리하며 세계의 패권 국가로서의 위치를 지켜냈습니다. 1931년 개정된 자치법은 자치령들에게 제한된 권리만을 부여하였으며, 원래의 권리들을 대폭 수정당한 자치령들은 본국에게 대단히 분노했습니다. 영국은 위태로운 입장에 서있습니다. 1937년 제국회의는 더욱 가까워졌고, 앞으로 영국이 겪을 몇 년 동안 제국의 운명은 물론 영국 자체의 미래를 결정할 선택들에 직면할 것입니다."

ENG_expand_control:0 "정치 통제력 강화"
ENG_expand_control_desc:0 "Many areas of Ireland are still ruled poorly and loosely by several British citizens more concerned with making wealth than helping locals. To ensure Ireland is happy with the current arrangement we must stamp out these profiteers and ensure proper control."
ENG_ire_invest:0 "아일랜드 농촌에 투자"
ENG_ire_invest_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the poorest areas of the United Kingdom, rural Ireland needs investment to link it fully with the rest of the country and ensure the rule of law can extend to the countryside as well. To make things better, this will also assist in the RICs ability to counter the IRB."
ENG_ire_endreligdiscr:0 "종교적 차별 근절 정책"
ENG_ire_endreligdiscr_desc:0 "In many ways a relic from a bygone era, policies of religious discrimination against Catholics abound across the Irish isles. In order to ensure that all of Ireland is content with our rule we cannot play favouritism. Unfortunately this is likely to upset our supporters in the North of the country."
ENG_ire_reinforce_constab:0 "아일랜드 보안대 확충"
ENG_ire_reinforce_constab_desc:0 "The RIC is struggling to police the entirety of Ireland, and its numbers continue to dwindle from IRB attacks.

ENG_ire_discussion:0 "정치적 논의 장려"
ENG_ire_discussion_desc:0 "Since the Great War Ireland there has been a growing minority within the country that are content with the status quo. Engaging this group in Irish political discussions is crucial in creating the correct atmosphere for independence in Ireland."
ENG_ire_create_parliament:0 "아일랜드 의회 수립"
ENG_ire_create_parliament_desc:0 "While Parliament House in Dublin has existed since 1729, the creation of a formal Parliament requires more than a building to house Irish MPs. By beginning the slow transfer of additional power to the Irish Parliament it will at last become a fully functioning parliament with the ability to govern without British interference."
ENG_ire_united:0 "통일 아일랜드"
ENG_ire_united_desc:0 "Since Ireland's formal integration into the United Kingdom in 1800, all of the island of Ireland has been considered a single political identity, at least until the threat of Home Rule became apparent. Regardless of those agitating for a 'special relationship' with the United Kingdom Ireland must be a united political entity upon independence."
ENG_ire_divided:0 "얼스터스코트인 보호"
ENG_ire_divided_desc:0 "Since Home Rule was proposed in the late 19thC there has emerged an extremely loyal, and sometime radical, force within the North of Ireland. These Unionists are largely descendant of the Ulster Plantations and are unquestionably loyal to the United Kingdom. We cannot abandon these people."
ENG_ire_pass_homerule:0 "자치 법안 통과"
ENG_ire_pass_homerule_desc:0 "Successive Home Rule acts were passed in the years surrounding the Great War, with the final Fourth Home Rule Act being passed in 1920 which established a greater deal of autonomy for Ireland within the United Kingdom, though without some of the demands made by the Irish Parliamentary Party. Today we stand on the brink of passing the Fifth, and final, Home Rule Act, fulfilling previous promises of total independence for Ireland."

#####Imperial Future#####

ENG_statute_westminster:0 "웨스트민스터 헌장"
ENG_statute_westminster_desc:0 "Proposed in the Imperial Conferences of 1917-18 but never passed, the Statute of Westminster would be re-branded as the Statute of Autonomy after being picked apart in the House of Commons. Today the Statute of Westminster is yet to be fully realised, but many in the Dominions still hope that it can."

ENG_imp_fed:0 "제국 연방"
ENG_imp_fed_desc:0 "Proposed at the turn of the century, the idea of an Imperial Federation survived the Great War, but only barely. Proposed as an alternative to an ever decentralised Empire, the Imperial Federation has only in recent years become attractive as a political idea due to advances in technology and communication."
ENG_ris:0 "왕립 제국학회"
ENG_ris_desc:0 "Intellectuals from across the Empire meet regularly in London for conferences on new technological developments, but through the other days of the eyar remain relatively separated. To ensure research continues unabated across the Empire we can established a new society to foster technoligical development."
ENG_sup_loyal:0 "Support Overseas Loyalists"
ENG_sup_loyal_desc:0 "With our decision to pursue an Imperial Federation many of those living in the Dominions have been angered greatly by this new proposal. In order to solidify the case for the Imperial Federation we must work closely with, and support those loyalists to the Empire who live overseas."
ENG_rej_imp_conf:0 "Rejuvenate the Imperial Conferences"
ENG_rej_imp_conf_desc:0 "If the Imperial Federation is to be successful we must step up efforts to communciate with the Dominion representatives. Rejuvenating the Imperial Conferences - that have recently only been held once every 4 years - would be a step in the right direction to ensure cooperation between the Empire."
ENG_imp_parl:0 "Construct an Imperial Parliament"
ENG_imp_parl_desc:0 "Created to house the Imperial Representatives across the Empire, each Dominion will create their own Imperial Parliament which will convene once every three months to discuss Imperial affairs."
ENG_dom_integ:0 "자치령 의회 통합"
ENG_dom_integ_desc:0 "With the Imperial Parliament constructed the time has arrived to formally convert existing Members of Parliament of the Dominion nations and the British Isles to Members of the Imperial Parliament. Ostensibly a ceremonial affair, it will signal that the Imperial Federation is quickly becoming a reality."
ENG_common_eco:0 "통합 경제 정책"
ENG_common_eco_desc:0 "Imperial economics have in recent years seen its power undermined by Dominion Governments unwilling to cooperate with the rest of the Empire for the sake of unity. Only through merging our economic efforts once more will Imperial economic power be brought to bare on the world."
ENG_imp_command:0 "제국군 연합사령부"
ENG_imp_command_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the most divisive issues of the Great War was the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Dominion troops at the hands of British military leaders. This hurdle cannot be overcome easily, and to ensure that each Dominion has a say in military matters may weaken us politically, it will ensure Dominion loyalty in the long term."
ENG_diss_parl:0 "자치령 의회 재조직"
ENG_diss_parl_desc:0 "After years of painstaking work and effort, the time has finally arrived to reorganise the Dominion Parliaments and officially merge them into the Imperial Parliament. Up until this point the Dominions may have been happy to allow the Imperial Federation to play out, but if our relations our poor then this final effort may spur on rebellion across the Empire."

ENG_status_quo:0 "현상유지"
ENG_status_quo_desc:0 "Reforming the Empire will only lead to disaster, if we are to survive we must maintain what we have today and ensure its stability in the decades to come. The Dominions may resist our efforts, but they will learn as all others do - that they will ultimately bow to Britain."
ENG_bonds:0 "Strengthen the Bonds"
ENG_bonds_desc:0 "Weakened due to the horrific casualties suffered in the Great War, the bonds that bind the Empire need to be strengthened if we are to create a united front against our foes and remain a bulwark of stability in this fractious world."
ENG_empire_unity:0 "단결의 제국"
ENG_empire_unity_desc:0 "With stability ensured across the Empire and those conspiring reformers prevented from gaining power, we have created a new image of the Empire to show to the world. We are no longer an Empire divided, but an Empire of Unity."
ENG_promote_trade:0 "제국 무역 촉진"
ENG_promote_trade_desc:0 "To ensure continued economic development within the Empire and reliance upon ourselves, and only ourselves, we must promote trade between ourselves and the Dominions."
ENG_mil_coord:0 "제국군 통합"
ENG_mil_coord_desc:0 "While directly integrating military leadership does not seem terribly feasible, there is nothing stopping us from actively cooperating with the Dominions who have in recent years strengthened their military so that in many ways it is comparable to our own."
ENG_imp_science:0 "제국의 과학력"
ENG_imp_science_desc:0 "Efforts to continue research into new and exciting fields will only benefit greatly from a continued cooperation of Empire-wide science facilities. Rather than investing independently on new areas of research, we can work together and gain a greater lead over others than ever before."

ENG_decentralise:0 "자치령에게 자유를"
ENG_decentralise_desc:0 "The Wind of Change is blowing across the Empire. Whether or not we like it, this growth of national conciousness across the Empire and its Dominions cannot be sated. Only by continuing efforts to increase autonomy and decentralise power to the Dominions will we prevent calamity."
ENG_red_gg:0 "총독의 권한 축소"
ENG_red_gg_desc:0 "Holding tremendous power over our Dominions, the Governor-Generals have in recent years used their power sparingly but have still become a source of controversy in the Dominion nations, being viewed as nothing more than an extension of our power over them."
ENG_autono_fp:0 "자주적 외교 정책"
ENG_autono_fp_desc:0 "While a terrribly frightening idea to some, the Dominions cannot be granted total freedom unless they have the liberty to decide their own foreign policy regarding global affairs. While this may weaken or Empire's resolve in the long run, it will perhaps in the short term make us stronger."
ENG_estab_con:0 "영연방"
ENG_estab_con_desc:0 "While the end of the Empire in many ways seems near, we do not need to end cooperation between ourselves and our Dominion friends. By establishing the Common of Nations, an organisation where each participant holds equal power then we may ensure a modicum of unity between ourselves and the Dominions."
ENG_affirm_sow:0 "웨스트민스터 헌장 제정"
ENG_affirm_sow_desc:0 "With the Dominions having been granted far greater autonomy over the past several years than many though possible, it seems as if passing the Statute of Westminster is a purely ceremonial affair. Though it will show to the Dominion populations that while in 1931 the British Government made a mistake, that she would in recent times be willing to rectify it."

ENG_mil_review:0 "왕립군 재검토"
ENG_mil_review_desc:0 "It has been almost two decades since the end of the Great War and there are some in the upper echelons of the Government who worry the military is suffering from severe atrophy. With this in mind the Government is prepared to order an immediate review of the Armed Forces."

# - Army

ENG_recon_army:0 "영국군 재건"
ENG_recon_army_desc:0 "Suffering severely since the end of the Great War, the British Army is perhaps one of the worst effected areas of our military cut-backs. Severely under-equipped and still utilising out-dated equipment, the British Army has been found wanting, and we must ensure they are properly managed."

ENG_massingberd:0 "마싱버드의 기동사단"
ENG_massingberd_desc:0 "Sir Archibald Massingberd has made it very clear that he believes the best way to win a war is to push the enemy hard, fast and from multiple angles. As such he is promoting the establishment of the first ever mobile and mechanized divisions for the British Army."
ENG_moto_efforts:0 "차량화 착수"
ENG_moto_efforts_desc:0 "The first step in the creation of a more mobile army is to design vehicles that can carry our men wherever they need to go. Whether that be through the mud of Flanders, the jungles of central Africa or the deserts of the Near East."
ENG_lighttanks:0 "경전차 개발"
ENG_lighttanks_desc:0 "During the Great War our army employed huge landships as a means of covering infantry advances. With a few modifications we could perhaps shrink these down to increase their speed. This will come at the cost of firepower and armour, but it will allow them to support our mobile regiments or our maneuver enemy forces."
ENG_introcruisers:0 "Introduce the Cruisers"
ENG_introcruisers_desc:0 "Our mobile divisions, while fast, do not have the stopping power required even with light armour support to breakthrough enemy defences. It is time to bring forth the newest in military innovation. Cruiser's are a halfway point between the light Matilda’s and the old landships. Packing enough firepower to push forward but move swiftly enough that they can bring up the rear of mobile divisions."
ENG_deploy_ra:0 "Deploy the Royal Armoured"
ENG_deploy_ra_desc:0 "Massingberd’s dream has finally come true. With the implementation of the Cruisers we now have tanks which can fight and hold their own against the opposition whether they employ armour, artillery or infantry. With these new Cruisers our new military philosophy Massingberd has unveiled the first ever completely armoured divisions of the British Army during a parade in London city."

ENG_ironside:0 "아이언사이드의 포병"
ENG_ironside_desc:0 "Sir Edmund Ironside, having served in the fields both during the Boer War and the Great War, has argued vehemently that the lives of every British soldier should be of paramount importance to us. As such he has been calling for a greater focus on the Royal Artillery. After all, why risk the lives of brave men when we can simply shell our enemy into oblivion."
ENG_expand_ra:0 "왕립 포병대 확장"
ENG_expand_ra_desc:0 "The first step in the remodeling of the Army to fit Ironside’s view is to expand the Royal Artillery. While this arm of the British Army has traditionally been used to support the infantry on their assaults, the trenches of the Somme and Ypres have taught us that if used properly they can form the core of a battle plan just as well."
ENG_incorp_aa:0 "Incorporate Anti-Air Equipment"
ENG_incorp_aa_desc:0 "Artillery can play a much more diverse role than any other piece of equipment on the battlefield. With their massive range and the size of their shell they have been proven to take even the largest planes out of the sky. If we make more mobile versions of these and add them to the Royal Artillery we will have aerial protection for our infantry as well."
ENG_art_produ1:0 "Standardise Production Methods"
ENG_art_produ1_desc:0 "Originally artillery has been produced in several factories across our nation, and despite strict production standards there are times when artillery has often differed significantly in its production value. By establishing factories designed to create specific parts of artillery equipment and enforcing stricter standards we can hopefully improve our ability to produce artillery."
ENG_art_produ2:0 "Artillery-Specialised Factories"
ENG_art_produ2_desc:0 "We need to build more guns if we are to continue to fuel the Royal Artillery's needs, but even with a standardised production we can’t produce them anywhere near fast enough. The best way to help with this is to select certain factories across the countries and ensure they have specialised equipment and designs to continue building up our stockpile of artillery undeterred."

ENG_haig:0 "헤이그의 유산"
ENG_haig_desc:0 "Sir Douglas Haig more commonly known as “The Butcher of The Somme” had a fearsome reputation both to our enemies and our own troops. Known for designing plans that would end in the death of thousands of men both our own and our foes. While his victories were costly, his impeccable planning meant that even battles that seemed like defeats were turned into greater victories on a larger scale."
ENG_battleplan:0 "대전략"
ENG_battleplan_desc:0 "Every battle, every engagement, every march much serve a purpose in the greater plan for victory. The farther ahead we plan our battles the more likely we are to achieve greater victories as we push forward. A loss in one area if expected and planned could lead to a greater victory in another."
ENG_supporttanks:0 "보병 지원 전차"
ENG_supporttanks_desc:0 "Infantry can not win battles on their own, especially not when facing heavy armour or fortified positions. If we develop new types of armour to support our troops acting as both as cover and mobile gun emplacements we should be able to push up to and hopefully through enemy lines."
ENG_entrenchment:0 "참호전의 교훈"
ENG_entrenchment_desc:0 "We have learned many lessons from the Great War. Mainly in the creation, assault and defence of trenches and other fortifications. If we apply our new planning theories to these old lessons we should be able to create more effectual defences and fortifications on our front lines."
ENG_landship:0 "육상전함"
ENG_landship_desc:0 "Battleships have been the corner stone of our navy since their inception and their philosophy of massive blocks of metal and firepower have served us well at sea. Why can’t we apply this to our armour? With massive tanks covering our advances and retreats we will be able to move troops in a much safer a manner."

ENG_rmarines:0 "왕립 해병대"
ENG_rmarines_desc:0 "The Royal Marines have been a regiment of the Royal Military for almost three hundred years, but until now they have been under the purview of the Royal Navy. However, a request has been made to establish the Royal Marines as independent of both the Army and Navy. This newfound autonomy will allow us to plan a greater number of naval invasion and with greater success."
ENG_rparas:0 "왕립 공수부대"
ENG_rparas_desc:0 "Planes have become a part of our military more and more in recent years. They can penetrate deep behind enemy lines which means if we can deliver them to the ground safely we will be able to have specialised elite troops far behind the enemy defences to both waylay their supplies and take key positions while regular armed forces push in at the front."
ENG_renew_mil:0 "영국 육군의 이미지 개선"
ENG_renew_mil_desc:0 "Ever since the Great War fewer and fewer young men have been volunteering to join the British Army. Whether that was caused by the immense casualty rates, the perceived peace or just the changing idea of war does not matter. We need to reimagine and revitalise the image of the Black Watch, the Highlanders and the Grenadiers in order to attract new men to our armed forces."

# - RAF

ENG_theraf:0 "왕립 공군"
ENG_theraf_desc:0 "The face of the battlefield is changing. More and more frequently during the Great War we saw aircraft take to the skies in combat roles and at the end of the last war we created the RAF: the first independent airforce in the world. But as times change and technology advances we need to continue forward if we are to keep ahead of our competitors both technologically and tactically."

ENG_harris:0 "해리스의 폭격기"
ENG_harris_desc:0 "Sir Arthur Harris has been arguing for several years now that small single or two-man planes are not what will win us wars in the future nor can they protect British shores. That to win we must have the ability to strike our enemies heartland and cripple him beyond repair."
ENG_strat_destruct:0 "전략적 파괴"
ENG_strat_destruct_desc:0 "Controlling our own skies serves a purpose but it will not win us a war the only way to win a war is to strike at your opponent and crush them. As such, our leaders have developed plans and tactics that focus on using our multi-engine bombers to drop massive payloads over enemy industrial and military targets."
ENG_lrange_escorts:0 "장거리 전투기 호위"
ENG_lrange_escorts_desc:0 "Our bombers do the job; every time they cross the Channel they pound enemy regions into dust. However, of late our foe’s response time has increased, resulting in more of our bombers being shot down. If we are to continue with our bombing runs we must develop fighter planes that have a similar range to that of our bombers if we want to reduce our losses and ensure we continue striking our enemies."
ENG_future_invest:0 "미래에 투자하다"
ENG_future_invest_desc:0 "The future of aviation and aerial warfare comes in the form of multi-engine planes, their range, their payload, their firepower, all are superior to other forms of aeronautic machines. Our government needs to invest in companies like Avro and Lancaster in order to ensure we have a stead flow of these powerful machines."

ENG_ccommand:0 "RAF Coastal Command"
ENG_ccommand_desc:0 "While the Royal Navy can protect us for naval incursion the RAF could play a significant role in that as well. By developing planes specifically designed to attack naval vessels and ports while also stationing RAF command posts near and on our coasts, we could greatly aid in protecting our home and expanding our power abroad."
ENG_assist_rn:0 "Assisting the Royal Navy"
ENG_assist_rn_desc:0 "The Royal Navy has always been the preeminent power of the Royal Military, but against attacks from the air it must rely on Heavy Cruisers equipped with Anti-Air canons to protect itself. Our researchers could however begin development on new Naval Bombers to assist in the destruction of enemy naval power."
ENG_defend_coast:0 "Defending our Coastline"
ENG_defend_coast_desc:0 "The British Isles are well defended from both naval and amphibious assault, the only glaring weakness in our defences is if we are attacked from the skies. While the RAF is a powerful defensive force it cannot be everywhere at once and does take time to scramble in the events of a raid. The danger of this could be mitigated if we were to construct some anti-aircraft emplacements along our coasts."

ENG_portal:0 "포탈의 지상공격기"
ENG_portal_desc:0 "Sir Charles Portal has always been of the impression that the greatest advantage the RAF can bring to the Armed Forces is by acting as support for the British Army, protecting our soldiers from aerial assault and providing close air support for our infantryman on the ground."
ENG_support_army:0 "영국 육군 지원"
ENG_support_army_desc:0 "While controlling the skies is all well and good there are other tactics we could employ to better support the lads on the ground. If we were to develop small maneuverable bombers that could strike at the supply convoys, artillery batteries and even armour on the field we could feasibly save thousands of infantry men while also bleeding our enemies dry."
ENG_control_skies:0 "창공을 통제하라"
ENG_control_skies_desc:0 "If our military campaigns are to be successful we need to control the skies above the fighting. If this is to be possible we will need to both increase the production rate of our newer fighters but also invest in new and innovative fighter technologies which could increase speed, firepower and maneuverability."
ENG_develop_fighters:0 "신규 전투기 프로토타입"
ENG_develop_fighters_desc:0 "Our designers have spent the last months working on a new fighter project which has been codenamed Project Meteor. This project was intended to create an entirely new generation of fighter which will use a new type of jet engine propulsion in an attempt to gain an advantage in speed and range over our foes."

ENG_radar_concept:0 "RDF 도입"
ENG_radar_concept_desc:0 "Radio Detection Finding or more simply RDF has been an idea since 1934. The theory behind it is to use Radio waves to detect approaching enemies before even spyglasses could see them. This will give us the ability to scramble the RAF and the rest of the military in advance of any assault. Assuming it works that is."
ENG_controlled_intercept:0 "지상제어 요격 체계"
ENG_controlled_intercept_desc:0 "RDF has turned out to be a smashing success, allowing the RAF to be prepared well in advance of enemy raids. But we could take this farther. By having operators in the RDF stations in contact with the RAF pilots at all times we could feasibly direct them to the weakest points of enemy bomber and fighter squadrons allowing for greater tactical efficacy and more co-ordinated flying."
ENG_future_warfare:0 "전장의 미래"
ENG_future_warfare_desc:0 "Air power is the most effective way to project our military power across the globe. Unlike the Navy and the Army, it is capable of fighting and supporting our troops wherever we need to send them. Some of our scientists have been discussing the idea of making weapons and engines molded after rocket batteries. These could deliver a powerful payload long distances without risking human lives."

ENG_nott_project:0 "포튼다운 프로젝트"
ENG_nott_project_desc:0 "Opened in 1916 to test chemical weapons used during the Great War, Porton Down has since come to encompass all experimental military projects currently in development in the United Kingdom, including their newest and most encompassing task. Codenamed the Porton Down Project."

ENG_thern:0 "바다의 주인"
ENG_thern_desc:0 "The Royal Navy has been the pride of Britain since our glorious victory at the Battle of Trafalgar back in 1805, establishing itself as the most powerful naval force the world has ever seen, with our country using it to great effect in expanding and protecting the borders of our Empire. After the Great War much has changed, and even the Royal Navy has seen a decrease in popularity and in quality. It is time to rectify this."

ENG_faa:0 "항공기로 무장한 함대"
ENG_faa_desc:0 "With the additional of Carriers to the Royal Navy new strategic possibilities have arisen. If we work together with the expanding RAF we will be able to continue to be the naval innovator of the world and push the Empire into a new phase of naval warfare. One in which we have a major advantage."
ENG_exercises:0 "제독들을 설득하다"
ENG_exercises_desc:0 "Convincing the Admiralty to move their focus from the big ships that have served the Royal Navy so well over the past century will prove exceedingly difficult. Many of the leadership in the Admiralty are staunchly in the favour of building ever more larger and powerful battleships to ensure we continue to have complete superiority over our foes."
ENG_protocv:0 "프로토타입 항공모함 설계"
ENG_protocv_desc:0 "Several members of the Royal Navy's Research Division have been working on designs for what they have called Project Dauntless. A new generation of naval carriers that will function as mobile airfields across the Seven Seas, allowing us to project moer power than ever before."
ENG_gwlessons:0 "대전쟁의 교훈"
ENG_gwlessons_desc:0 "During the Great War both in the English Channel and the North Sea we fought the Huns and their Kaisermarine. Here we learned many things about the modern face of naval warfare that we need to apply to our new carrier-based fleet lest we face a disaster like Jutland again."
ENG_escort_vessels:0 "호위함"
ENG_escort_vessels_desc:0 "While carriers are a powerful ship-class and the planes they transport more than able to deal damage to opposing fleets, they are not indestructible. Recent naval exercises have shown that without a large number of escort vessels carriers are easily dispatched by even a relatively small force. To ensure their safety we must design a new wave of Cruiser vessels."
ENG_exp_shipyards1:0 "해군 조선소 확장"
ENG_exp_shipyards1_desc:0 "If Project Dauntless is to come to succeed we will not only need reaserchers to design these new carriers, but also shipyards large enough to accomodate their construction. As such the Admiralty has requested additional Government funding to expand several pre-existing dockyards from which these new carriers will be constructed and launched."
ENG_reorg_admiralty:0 "해군 인사 재편성"
ENG_reorg_admiralty_desc:0 "Now with Project Dauntless in full swing we can finally deal with the bloat in our naval command structure. Many of the old guard still do not quite understand the tactics of aerial warfare or how to apply them at sea. If we pull up some young commanders from the Navy as well as perhaps some higher ups in the RAF we may be able to balance out this issue."
ENG_csg:0 "항공모함 타격전대"
ENG_csg_desc:0 "Up until now we have been focusing on using the Carriers and their payloads to assault enemy vessels on the water, but planes are not solely a naval weapon. If we organize our carrier aircraft into proper strike groups we could effectively use our navy to penetrate deeper inland allowing us to further support the British Army and RAF from the safety of the seas."

ENG_grandfleet:0 "웅장한 함대"
ENG_grandfleet_desc:0 "The Pride and Joy of the British Military ahs always been her Grand Fleet. She has been the envy of the world and has , in the end, defeated every major pwoer who sought to challenge her supremacy. The Royal Navy will continue in this task, and we will ensure that everywhere across the world a Royal Navy vessel will be found."
ENG_learn_jutland:0 "유틀란트 해전의 전훈"
ENG_learn_jutland_desc:0 "While ultimately a victory in the strategic sense, the Battle of Jutland was extremely close to a tactical defeat. The Kaisermarine's superior gunnery, better naval craftsmanship and better equipment ensured we suffered far greater losses than we should have in a battle where we had the far superior advantage. To avoid another calamity like this again we must learn from our past mistakes."
ENG_mod_bb:0 "현대 전함 설계"
ENG_mod_bb_desc:0 "Battleships are the pinnacle of naval warfare, with cannons capable of obliterating our foes from afar. As we learned during the Great War, however, our enemies are creating ships that can compete with ours. We must not let our advantage wane. The Royal Navy needs to leverage the newest techs to create a new generation of battleships fitting the prefix Her Majesty's Ship."
ENG_battlefleet:0 "전투함대 교리"
ENG_battlefleet_desc:0 "Due to our focus on the Battleship we have a consistent flow of new ships designs and strategies in which to employ them. While many of these ideas are years away, it would bring us a significant advantage to begin a series of naval exercises to familairise ourselves with these new concepts."
ENG_dd_screens:0 "대잠전 구축함"
ENG_dd_screens_desc:0 "On the surface of the oceans our Battleships are unmatche, in both numbers and technology we pull well ahead of our rivals. However, there is an unseen danger to our surface fleet. Beneath the waves German U-boats proved that they can sink even the largest ships in our fleet. To mitigate future losses from the submarine menace we must ensure our Destroyers remain up-to-date with new ASW technologies."
ENG_convoy_escort:0 "Convoy Escort Experience"
ENG_convoy_escort_desc:0 "Britain is an island that relies heavily on goods imported from the rest of the Empire. These convoys need to be protected during war time, but we can’t risk valuable battleships on this relatively minor mission. We need to create a newer model cruiser, light enough to keep pace with the convoy ships but with enough fire power to deter enemy ships and U-boats."
ENG_mobile_squad:0 "Mobile Squadrons"
ENG_mobile_squad_desc:0 "With an Empire as large and expansive as ours having the largest and heaviest Battleship only serves to allow us to defeat our foes, but only if we catch them first. Building upon the Battlecruiser philosophy of the Great War we will create a new generation of vessels with armament equal of any Battleship, but with the speed to catch maurading vessels harassing our trade routes."
ENG_fast_bb:0 "고속전함"
ENG_fast_bb_desc:0 "As the Admiralty places a new emphasis on speed rather than superior armament, a new class of Battleships will need to be developed. Ships emphasising speed and expediency for dealing with threats across our vast Empire as they arise."

ENG_target_tax_desc:0 "We have spent ourselves so far into the red that if we don’t find a way to at least take some of the pressure of we will officially be bankrupt. The best way to try and at least slow the drop would be a tax, but that would defeat the purpose of trying to put more money in the people hands.

ENG_tariffs:0 "관세 수입"
ENG_tariffs_desc:0 "The Pound, while stable within our own borders has lost a great deal of it value world wide, buying goods from regions external to the Empire is now outrageously expensive.

ENG_national_effort_desc:0 "Mosley's plan actually worked. Regardless of the criticisms of nay-sayers and other inidividuals Britain has pulled through the worst of the economic crisis, and in record pace.

ENG_mil_cuts:0 "Slash Military Funding"
ENG_mil_cuts_desc:0 "Our soldiers fought valiantly in the great war, they were well paid and well equipped, but right now we need to decide what is more important, new guns and well-paid soldiers, or the national economy. The answer seems simple, it would seem the time has come to gut the British Military"
ENG_cut_benefits:0 "Cut Unemployment Benefits"
ENG_cut_benefits_desc:0 "Right now, we have some systems in place that pay the unemployed. If we trim these down to only those who are incapable of working for major medical reasons or better yet remove them entirely, we can not only save money but incentives peoples to go out and join the work force."
ENG_cut_invest2:0 "Reduce National Investment"
ENG_cut_invest2_desc:0 "Some people argue that you need to spend money in order to make money, but in some cases, that is just not feasible. In a crisis such as this, we must withdraw funding that is not necessary from everywhere we can, including those areas in Britain that we have invested in."

ENG_lift_caps:0 "Lift Interest Caps"
ENG_lift_caps_desc:0 "Lifting interest caps on loans to businesses throughout the Empire may result in many businesses going out of business, but if they can't afford to pay back these loans, why did they take them out in the first place?"
ENG_liberate_markets:0 "시장 자유화"
ENG_liberate_markets_desc:0 "The Government has no business in business, so the saying goes.

ENG_lifeline_desc:0 "Officially opened in November of 1869, the Suez Canal has since functioned as an extremely important location to ensure continued communication and supply from the heartland of Britain to the farthest reaches of the Empire.

ENG_decen_command:0 "Decentralised Command"
ENG_decen_command_desc:0 "Should the unthinkable happen and enemy soldiers gain a foothold on our island, we must prepare ourselves to fight tooth and nail to defeat them.

ENG_renew_territorials:0 "Reactivate the Territorials"
ENG_renew_territorials_desc:0 "The Territorials are a volunteer regiment which prior to the Great War was designed to act as a last line of defence should an enemy land on our soil.

ukbw.1.d:0 "As the effects of the London Market Collapse continue to influence the financial situation of our nation more and more companies and businesses are going bankrupt. Today a prominent company that owns several factories in one of our prominent industrial regions announced that they would be closing several unprofitable factories in the area in an effort to cut costs and stay afloat.\n\nUnfortunately this is going to result in an increase in unemployment and the inability for the Government to continue using the factory."
ukbw.2.d:0 "In an attempt to cut costs several important businesses in our nation have begun slashing employee salaries in order to save themselves money in the production of goods in the region. While these cuts normally go through with only minor grumbling, a local trade union has announced a strike in several of the factories effected. The company owners are unwilling to negotiate with the strikers and for the time being it will result in decreased production in the area."
ukbw.3.d:0 "With a local strike taking shape in one of our more influential industrial regions, owners of the factories effected have decided to negotiate with the trade union orchestrating the strike. The owners have invited the Government to mediate the dispute over the coming week, this is likely to sap some degree of our attention so long as the situation persists."

Today King Edward VIII visited an area particularly affected by the economic crisis, and while his visit was supposed to be a morale-booster for those worst effected, it has had some unforeseen consequences. The King has apparently been quite effected by the plight of those suffering and made several political promises that indicate his intention to involve himself directly in order to solve the situation. Whether or not he does so does not matter by making these comments he has weakened our Government and increased public support for himself."

uk.1.d:0 "With its victory in the Great War against the Central Powers, Britain re-affirmed its status as the global hegemon through naval domination. However the horrendous cost in casualties impacted the internal politics of the Empire more than could have been forseen. In the Imperial Conferences of 1917-18, Britain had promised her Dominions 'a full recognition as autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth', with the purpose of increased autonomy and giving each Dominion in the Empire an 'adequate voice' in foreign policy, rights that were to be eventually extended to British India as well. \n\nDespite these promises, with victory comes hubris, British politicians preferred to see a resumption of a status quo in the Empire, with Dominions nominally subservient to London; they feared that any increase in autonomy may eventually lead to the break-up of the Empire that those in the Great War had fought and died to defend. This political crisis abated as the economic boom in Great Britain spread throughout the Empire. As manufacturing levels in the Empire soared, so did the need for resources, and with an expansive colonial empire, Britain was not short for needed goods, however the method of procuring increased resources was to come at a price. \n\nRapid industrialisation and resource extraction led to the mass employment of colonial people's in order to fuel the Empire, their conditions were poor and their payment worse, something that British politicians were willing to forget so long as the money continued to flow. Eventually these conditions reached a boiling point, with the crucible being achieved in India. \n\nToday the revolt has spread. India is on the precipice of leaving the Empire, the British garrison is few and those in revolt, numerous. To make matters worse, since the refusal of the House of Commons to pass the Statute of Westminster in 1931 - with it instead a highly cut down version of the bill being passed, the Statute of Autonomy -, relations with the Dominion states have soured greatly. The up-coming Imperial Conference of 1937 is sure to see a renewed interest in the autonomy of the Dominion states of the Empire. Should Westminster once again decide to delay autonomy then she may face further rebellion than just her India territories, but if she should acquiesce, it may mean the end of the Empire altogether."
uk.2.d:0 "Last week saw a tumultuous five days for the London Stock Market. Fuelled by fears of a shortage of goods and resources due to the on-going revolt in colonial Africa and India, the stock exchange continued to vary wildly as news dripped out from Westminster regarding efforts to prevent further insurrection throughout the Empire.\n\nIt appears the worst was yet to come.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the trial of the CEO of Hatry Group - prominent businessman Clarence Hatry - and his associates with the imprisonment of all those under investigation for the crimes of mass fraud and forgery, investor confidence in the stock market plummeted. Mass selling ensued over the course of today, with traders seemingly in a frenzy of panic.\n\nAs the Government scrambles to find a way to prepare for the economic repurcussions, the effects of the 1936 London Stock Market Crash are certain to be felt beyond Britain, most of all in the Empire and its Dominions."

Known for his courage and passion in military matters, His Majesty even visited troops near the front-line on the Western Front. \n\nA man known for his love of both family and country, thousands have taken to the streets across our Empire, from Winnipeg to Wellington, to mourn the loss of one of the most beloved monarchs in our history."
uk.400.d:0 "Much like his father before him King Edward VIII is a strong-willed man and in many ways tirelessly stubborn. Shirking off many of the protective measures employed by the Household Guard, our new King is determined to be seen as a man of the people. Something, he says, cannot be accomplished if he has a large number of bodyguards following him around all day.\n\nAs such he has begun refusing to be seen with a significant detachment of bodyguards in public. The King's advisors have reminded him time and again that while the people may respond positively to the way he mingles among them without fear, it does place him at significant risk.\n\nWhile the King has authority on this matter and we cannot force him to agree to our whims, perhaps it would be wise to allow the normal security detachment to instead 'volunteer' to remain close by. For his protection, of course."

As the crowd scattered from the gunman, it was discovered moments later that the King was dead, suffering a gun-shot wound to the chest which is believed to have pierced his heart. \n\nThe nation is in shock. Not only is this the first murder of a Monarch since Charles I almost three hundred years ago, it is the first time a gunman has been able to close to within firing distance of a member of the Royal Family. Questions have been raised as to the efficiency of Scotland Yard and how this could have been allowed to occur, but more worringly the identity and motive of the gunman is yet to be determined. \n\nAlready whispers have begun to spread regarding the murder. Some say that he was a known Marxist, dedicated to the cause of anti-imperialism, which he regarded the British monarchy as champions of. Others tell tales that he was a colonial revolutionary, determined to see his nation free from the control of the Empire. The truth may be worse than either of these rumours; it may be that we will never discover the gunman's true motives. Whatever the case, the assassination of King-Emperor Edward VIII has sent shockwaves through the political establishment in Britain. \n\nA tentative calm has fallen over Britain, with some believing that the worst is yet to come."

Due to the valiant efforts of members of the crowd, the would-be assassin was tackled to the ground and held in position until members of Scotland Yard hurried to the location. \n\nSo far the King-Emperor has released a statement regarding the situation saying that he and his family were unharmed, yet somewhat shook, by the attempted murder. Quietly questions are being asked about the competency of Scotland Yard which allowed a gunman to get within firing distance of a member of the Royal Family. Although many are simply glad that the assassination was a failure. \n\nThe man in question, identified as one Jerome Bannigan, has been placed in custody of Scotland Yard with his trial pending. A known fraudster, the motives for the attempted murder are unknown at this time, it may be many months before a reason is identified, if one can be found at all. \n\nFor many, this recent act is emblematic of a larger political problem in the Empire. For others, they are simply happy to know that for now a crisis has been averted."
uk.6.d:0 "As the new year begins, the date of the next Imperial Conference approaches ever closer. While still several months away, preparations are currently being made to host the Imperial delegates of the Conference. Work so far has focused in London, the traditional meeting place of the Conference, we have however been recently contacted by the Dominion of Canada regarding a possible change of location.\n\nThe Canadians propose that we instead host the conference in Ottawa where they have been secretely working on their own building to host the event.\n\nWhile this choice is relatively benign, it may serve to improve relations between ourselves and our Dominions by showing that this Empire is truly one of equals. Although hosting it in London will send the message not only to the Dominions, but to the world, that the British Empire has but one master."
uk.7a.d:0 "This morning the Prime Minister of Great Britain formally opened the Fourteenth Imperial Conference in London. Imperial Delegates from throughout the Empire are set to debate numerous imporant issues regarding the future of our great nations.\n\nEach Delegation opened with a small speech of their own which is likely to indicate their own interests in the Conference. Notably the Canadian delegation once again announced their support for the backing of the Statute of Westminster and increased autonomy for all Dominion nations, including British India. The Australian and New Zealand delegations made a joint statement where they wished to express interest in increased investment in their territories, as well as policies where the British Government would encourage immigration to both Australia and New Zealand. The Irish and Indian delegation raised their concern of growing unrest in both of their nations, as well as their interest in more autonomy as a means of counter-acting it.\n\n While many within our Government are considering these statements as the usual complaints and suggestions, others believe that if they are not properly resolved in this Imperial Conference that we may see increased revolt against our rule. Whatever our choices, we must move carefully lest we lose control of the Empire altogether."

uk.8.d:0 "The agenda on the first day of the 1937 Imperial Conference is to be the economic policy of the Empire. Many of our Dominions, and the Home Isles included, are still suffering greatly from the effects of the London Market Collapse only 9 months ago. With our industrial and economic leverage over the Empire, it will be possible for us to determine the course we will take together to solve this crisis.\n\nWhile we have only limited investment to spare for the Dominions, we can target it to a specific area to assist them in their construction. The most popular idea that has been raised for far by the combined Australasian delegates is one of increased industrial construction, to facilitate bringing more of the unemployed back into the workplace, and to spur on the combined economies of the Empire. Alternatively we may also divert our investment towards the construction of infrastructure throughout the Empire, to allow us to access the more remote territories of the Empire with greater ease.\n\nFinally, there are those who suggest that this investment should go towards militarising the Empire, as there are fears that with growing instability in both Europe and abroad, we may be required to involve ourselves more directly in the coming future."
uk.9.d:0 "Given our dominant military position over the parts of the Empire, it has come to us to decide our united foreign policy in regards to the coming years.\n\nSince the end of the Great War we have retreated into isolation as a means of preserving the integrity of our Empire, although with growing threats abroad this policy is regularly being challenged within the Empire.\n\nOur first choice is to continue the policy of isolation that we have maintained since the end of the Great War, while this policy is likely to ensure the stability of our nation and the Empire at large, it will limit our ability to pursue meaningful affairs with other nations around the world.\n\nThe final alternative is one that is surely to generate the most resistance from the Dominions, the proposition that we once again attempt to expand our Empire. While we do already control over a quarter of the globe, the more hawkish members of our Parliament and others firmly believe that when Empires stop expanding they eventually fall, in this case we must exapnd or perish. This policy brings with it the greatest risks, but also the greatest opportunities. Any attempt to make expansionism Imperial Policy is likely to shake the foundations of our Empire."
uk.10.d:0 "Perhaps the most important day of this year's Imperial Conference has arrived, the meeting where we dicsuss the combined future of the Empire.\n\nSince its inception, Westminster has always attempted to maintain control over the Dominions and while this was difficult in the early days of our Empire, it has grown increasingly easier as technology has finally caught up. During this time Dominion states have grown accustomed to their autonomy and many of the delegations, notably the Canadians, have only demanded more as their nation has both become richer and more populous during the economically booming 1920's.\n\nThe only thing that is known for sure is that any attempt to further pursue the Status Quo is likely to lead to increased dissidence against our rule, one that may have unforeseen consequences for both ourselves and others. With this in mind, many believe that the time has come to begin loosening the chains that bind our Dominions altogether, and to begin the moves towards their ultimate independence. However, there is another alternative.\n\nPrior to the Great War, an energetic part of the political class both in Britain and in the Dominions had been advocating for a type of Federation between the Empire. One where the Dominions would be granted equal representation inside a proposed Imperial Parliament, where all the parts of the Empire would be united. Those who support this arrangement argue that it may stamp out all attempts at future independence of our Dominion states, while making us an exceptionally strong force on the global stage. The critics of this policy argue that it would be impossible to force either the Indian or South African delegations to accept this measure, and that we would likely see revolt in both of these locations should we attempt any to impose direct rule from London.\n\nOur choices are many, and their consequences potentially disastrous for the Empire. Today will mark a major turning point of our Empire regardless of which decision we make. For the sake of everything we hold dear, we must choose carefully."
uk.11.d:0 "While the topic of greater autonomy for Ireland was not expected to be raised during the Fourteenth Imperial Conference, the Irish delegation took the time to gain support from the Dominions of the Empire as a means of pressuring Westminster into once more revisiting the issue.\n\nThe issue of the Irish Republican Brotherhood continuing to attack and disrupt our ability to govern Ireland has been raised, and many in our Government believe that the time may have arrived to finally give Ireland a greater degree of Home Rule as a means of starving the Brotherhood politically. \n\nThe hard-liners in our Government suggest that if we cave politically to autonomy now, it will only embolden the IRB to take further action against us, potentially making a more significant impact politically if they can succeed in claiming they were the reason for more autonomy being granted. Those who oppose Home Rule therefore argue that the time has arrived for us to politically push for an acceptance of the status quo in Ireland. \n\nThe process will likely entail compromise and may not triumph, but its success will mean an end to the IRB and an end to political troubles in Ireland, with this in mind perhaps a greater degree of Home Rule will solve our problems at the very least temporarily."
uk.12.d:0 "This evening the Fourteenth Imperial Conference has been formally concluded by statements from each Imperial Delegation. Whle our choices so far have made little impact throughout an Empire as expansive as ours, it will not take long before the Governments of the respective Dominion states effected by our policies officially meet and forge their own reaction to our decisions. In the coming weeks and months we may see increased instability throughout the Empire as the Dominions begin to adapt to the new reality.\n\nWe must prepare ourselves for any eventuality, and stand fast against any attempts to destroy the Empire from without, or perhaps, from within."
uk.20.d:0 "As the London Market Collapse continues to effect the world, there is no place hurt more than our own nation. The Tyneside town of Jarrow has been particularly damaged by the effects of the economic crash, with several factories being closed, and the important Palmer's Shipyard.\n\nToday several hundred now unemployed men held a meeting where they announced their intention to march to London in order to present the Government with a petition to re-open the industry in Jarrow that is crucial to employment.\n\nWhile normally this sort of event would go unnoticed, the media has made much fuss of it, and it has attracted both the attention and imagination of the public going so far as to win support of some more prominent local leaders.\n\nAs the March continues over the coming month it will likely be a source of political instability that will only inflame the on-going political crisis following the London Market Collapse."
uk.21.d:0 "As the Jarrow March enters its first week there have been numerous worrying signs of public approval and support for the marchers which was particularly emphasised today.\n\nMarchers were greeted by several locals as they entered Ferryhill in County Durham, where they were offered food and drink as well as a great showing of support. This is expected to continue as the march progresses as many within our nation suffer identical situations to the Jarrow Marchers."
uk.22.d:0 "Media attention of the Jarrow March spiked once again today as local Clergymen turned out in Ripon, with even the local Bishop appearing to offer support for the Marchers. It is clear from even a few days of coverage that the Jarrow March is likely to attract significant public interest."
uk.23.d:0 "As the Jarrow March continues to attract public attention throughout our country, we have recieved worrying news from local police officers in the area as to new elements infiltrating the March itself. Suspected members of both the British Socialist Party and the Worker's International League have apparently been stirring up trouble during the March by attempting to encourage those marching to become more vocal and forceful in their refutations of Government policy.\n\nWhile so far they appear to have been unsuccessful, many within our Government have begun to worry that the Jarrow March may soon become a front for the radical socialist elements of our society, which may then attempt to use it to cause disruption in the capital.\n\nFacing this we are left with two choices; allow the march to continue and deal with whatever consequences may occur, or order the police to end the march now, likely to the great detriment to our Government."
uk.24.d:0 "This morning as the Jarrow Marchers entered London, several members of the march attacked nearby members of Police when they tried to re-direct them down a less crowded street. After the attack, the Police were forced to defend themselves and arrested several members of the crowd.\n\nThe Newspapers, as is typical of them, have plastered images of the affair all over their front pages and it has only served to damage our Government further. Scotland Yard has identified several of the marchers as members of the BSP and CPB and has advised us to put an end to the march now before it gets further out of hand as more radical individuals are drawn to the event."
uk.25.d:0 "After almost a month of walking, the Jarrow Marchers have finally arrived in London. It appears that the Communist Party of Britain was 'coincidentally' holding a rally in Hyde Park right before the Marchers arrived, which has served only to swell the number of those involved. While police estimates that the crowed is less than 3,000 it may grow over the coming days as the Marchers prepare to officialy hand over their petition to the Government to re-open Palmer's shipyard and several other key industries in Jarrow."
uk.26.d:0 "This morning, the numbers of Police following the Jarrow March swelled in number as preparations were made to break-up the march before it could reach the capital on fears that greater disturbances would occur once they reached their destination. On our orders Scotland Yard successfuly, yet somewhat brutally, disbanded the march and those forming the core of the marchers were arrested and shipped back to Jarrow. The more radical elements of the march fled quickly as the Police approached, apparently forseeing what was to come.\n\nTypically the media has made a large fuss of the entire situation, accusing the Government and Scotland Yard of barbarism in the face of peaceful protest. The Government's popularity has been significantly damaged by this affair, but we may have avoided something far worse should we have allowed the march to continue."
uk.27.d:0 "This morning the Jarrow Marchers handed over their petition to several MPs outside Westminster that is to be debated later in the House of Parliament. While the Government is not in the habit of caving to the demands of a town with a relatively low population, the Jarrow March has captured the attention of the nation and our response will likely be examined and criticised for years to come.\n\nAny concessions to Jarrow will likely only encourage other towns to ask for similar Government intervention, but by refusing the petition our Government stands to allow more extremist political forces to make inroads in Britain's politics."
uk.28.d:0 "The London Market Collapse has affected millions of people across the Empire, but none more so then the working class citizens of the North of England. The city of Manchester and its surrounding towns are dependent on cotton mills and cotton exports, so the severe decline in our countries exports has had a dire effect on the region with many companies going bust and the closure of factories and mills has resulted in hundreds of people being unemployed and impoverished. Factory and Mill workers fear for their jobs and families, and many have seen their wages cut causing major unrest in the area. This unrest has today caused disparate strikes throughout the region, with the biggest of these strikes taking place in the industrial town of Rochdale.\n\nAt 9:00 this morning, workers from one of the largest cotton mills in the town abandoned their work and marched out of the mill and onto the streets, blocking all traffic. They proceeded to march together to the town centre, all the while chanting and demanding better wages and working conditions with some even waving red flags. These strikes are unorganised and pose little threat but they should not be underestimated, they are a sign that our people are reaching breaking point.\n\nShould this crisis continue, we may face far worse than this in the coming months."
uk.29.d:0 "As the largest operating Trade Union in the region, the Mill Workers Union recently hosted representatives from every Manchester Trade Union at an undisclosed location. While it is not unusual for Trade Unions to co-operate, it is highly unusual for it to happen on such a scale and in apparent secrecy, consequently the event has attracted enormous amounts of local media attention with many speculating what its effects will be.\n\nWhatever was discussed at that meeting, it is surely not going to be good for us."
uk.30.d:0 "The now nationwide famous Manchester Strikes have resulted today in the delivering of their demands to the Lord Mayor for Manchester Joseph Toole – an ex Labour MP who is now said to have an unofficial affiliation with the ILP. Their demands include, but are not limited to:\n\n1- An increase in workers’ wages.\n2- A commitment to improve the working and living conditions of workers.\n3- Employers must listen to the grievances of their workers and, where possible, assist in the alleviation of these issues.\n\nThe presenting of these demands gives the Government two choices: accept, or decline. To accept would be to submit to the will of the workers, and lose face with the rest of the world and our own people. To decline would mean violence and the potential for terrible bloodshed, should these strikers refuse to back down."
uk.31.d:0 "With Westminster's insistence that be deal with the growing crisis in Manchester as quickly as possible we have sent numerous negotiators to deal with the strikers and their trade union affiliaties in Manchester. Today the negotiators have sent word to their representatives in Westminster that they have succeeded in working out a deal, apparently it was not as large a challenge as they expected, the trade union officials in particular were eager to take what they could get and refrained from making any serious demands."
uk.32.d:0 "After the strikes in Manchester were broken up by the Police in the area following our command the situation has been relatively quiet in the areas previously effected, it wasn't until today that we received more news regarding the matter.\n\nFollowing police brutality in the break up of the strikes and numerous injuries, trade union officials in Manchester have met with their counter-parts across the nation in an attempt to rally support for strikes and we have recently received word that they have been successful in convincing the other trade unions that action is required. Speculation persists as to the meeting itself, with many suggestions that there may have been a National Trade Union Congress in the making with the intention of setting up local political infrastructure in the event of more organised actions. For now it is anyone's guess what that action will involve, although we are sure to find out soon."
uk.33.d:0 "It has become apparent in the past week that the plans of the Trade Union officials across the country have been put into motion quickly and effectively. Leaflets were reportedly distributed to union members in several major towns and cities to prepare for action during this week, and to be ready at a moments notice. It was not until yesterday morning that Trade Union officials announced that a General Strike will be going ahead in the coming week in an attempt to force the Government to fold on numerous policies not only being implemented in Manchester but elsewhere as well. Our Government must act soon to head off this potential disaster in the making, we must choose our response carefully."
uk.34.d:0 "After a week of tenuous negotiations held with Trade Union leaders in London, an agreement has finally been reached between their side and the Government. We will agree to roll-back several salary cuts in the worst areas effected throughout the nation, and guarantee that several Government owned industries will remain open to prevent further unemployment.\n\nThis whole situation has seriously weakened our Government's standing in the eyes of the British people, but perhaps the alternative would have been far worse."
uk.35.d:0 "Following orders from Westminster to launch a crack-down on the planned nation-wide general strike police forces were successful in breaking up several planned strikes before they began early yesterday morning, however word spread quickly among Trade Unions throughout the country. Today they have hastily erected barricades in several important industrial districts in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and even some section of London. Police Commanders have reported that they are unable to break the defences of several locations without serious use of force, while in other areas escalations are already taken place with violence being exhanged between the police and the strikers.\n\nAs it stands the situation is rapidly worsening with strikers fortifying their positions further as more time passes. Following this, our Government is left with little choice to deal with the situation."
uk.36.d:0 "Despite the recent declaration of martial law by the Government the revolters have progressed in many areas throughout the nation, securing additional streets and placing them under their nominal control. It appears that our heavy-handed approach to dealing with the situation has only led the public to become disillusioned with our own Government and side with the protestors.\n\nRegardless of these complications, it was not until this morning that events began to get much worse. Reports that military units have been refusing orders to put down civil unrest in many areas have begun to spread, in particular the brigade meant to be defending the London interior has only succeeded in holding back the protestors and has been unable to go on the offensive. Unless there is an immediate change in the the national situation we may face a level of unrest that up until now we had thought unthinkable. It is time for us to make a political statement if we are to resolve this crisis completely."
uk.37.d:0 "'Facing increased violence on the streets of Britain, the Government has saw fit to resign from its position in order to facilitate a fresh mandate from the people of Britain in order to adequately counter the current crisis.' These were the words announced by radio today as the continuing civil unrest throughout the nation spread further, with Westminster itself under threat from force.\n\nSince the Government's statement little has occurred and rioting has ceased in major areas as Trade Union officials in charge decide what to do. One part of the country however, has used this time to further their own agenda. King Edward VIII is said to have been meeting with military leaders regularly since the civil unrest began and Westminster announced the implementation of martial law. These meetings have been held in secret so far, but given the King's well known tendency to involve himself directly in political matters one does not need binoculars to see what may soon be coming to Britain.\n\n In the coming days and weeks the choices that we make will determine the future of Britain itself."
uk.38.d:0 "'Righteous justice and liberty has prevailed this day, the undemocratic and evil forces of Communism and Socialism who intended to forcibly ravage and destroy this great nation have been vanquished. As the God appointed monarch of this nation, I shall assume my role as the Head of this United Kingdom and her Government, in conjunction with the Anglican Church. Today marks a new era in British politics, and a brighter future for Britain and her Empire.' – The speech given by his Royal Majesty, King Edward VIII, after dissolving Parliament today.\n\nHis actions came as a great shock, not only to the people of Great Britain, but to the world as a whole as democracy has, for the first time since King Charles I, been discarded by the reigning monarch in an attempt for Absolute Monarchy. Many in the country view the actions of the King as a violation of their rights as people, with many socialists and communists protesting him fiercely stating that his actions are ‘the greatest violation of this country's people and their Human Rights we have ever seen.’ However, the King does have considerable support from inside the Government itself, with the majority of his support coming from the Military High Command and the ranks of the Military itself – thereby allowing Edward to assume control with very little resistance.\n\nDemocracy is one of the oldest British traditions and one can only wonder how long this new political reality will last."
uk.39.d:0 "Disaster has struck today, as our once loyal army collapsed into open revolt joining the rioting and protestors in London. The revolt took place following the orders given to Officers to open fire on the rioters, upon giving these orders their troops simply refused to act. When ordered once more to fire on the rioters, many troops began deserting and joining the ranks of the Socialists, with others firing on their own Officers. Needless to say, the rioting has now become more dangerous then we could ever have imagined and major firefights between the loyal units of the army and the rioters are taking place throughout London. While the remaining loyalist forces have positions in several important cities across the country, they are heavily outnumbered and will struggle to hold out for much longer. The Prime Minister, Sir Samuel Hoare, has today made a speech in the now paralysed House of Commons:\n\n'When these strikes began, it was inconceivable that the ridiculous politics of Socialism could ever shake the foundations of British democracy, and yet here we stand barricaded in our now irrelevant House of Commons surrounded by what of our military that has remained loyal to us. In this grand city, the centre of the world, Socialist and Collectivist insurgents run rampant destroying centuries of work by some of the greatest minds of mankind. Destroying the very democracy we seek to preserve and enjoy, the very democracy that is the basis of every right of every human. The very democracy that forms the basis of British morality and tradition. And yet, on this day, our own citizens seek to destroy this democracy, seek to destroy their own country for that matter, in the search for perfection. I speak for the whole of the House, I am sure, when I say that we have failed to deliver perfection. But I must also say, that they will never get any closer to it.'"

As we speak members of the Communist Party of Great Britain and the British Socialist Party are working with elements of the Trade Unions to establish a provisional Government to rule over our now liberated union.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks major changes will be taking place across the country as we implement a more radical and socialist policy for the economic, cultural and social renewal of Britain. Stand firm in the face of any attempts by reactionary forces to overthrow our rule, their attempts will be desperate and ultimately pointless; the workers are victorious, and their victory will reign supreme!\n\nYou are the vanguard of the Britain of tomorrow, one of equality, liberty and socialism.

uk.41.d:0 "With the resignation of the previous Government in Westminster an emergency General Election was called as a means of ensuring a mandate to deal with the growing political crisis across the nation. The election itself was called under the assumption that the so-called 'moderate' parties would be returned to the House of Commons with a majority needed to govern the nation, however it seems the past several weeks of unrest have drastically changed the political landscape in Britain.\n\nThe Conservatives and Labour Parties have been utterly crushed politically, with both parties not even securing the number of MPs required to form a Government should they have chosen to form a coalition. Instead the results have shown a clear shift towards the socialist parties in Britain, both radical and moderate.\n\nAs the final results pour in across the nation the greatest political upset in recent history is unfolding before our eyes, and its consequences will be felt for decades to come."
uk.42.d:0 "As the political crisis engulfing our country continues unabated, and only made worse by recent events in Manchester, many within our Government believe the time is rapidly approaching for the Government to call an early election as a means of securing a new mandate from the people of this country. Without doing so our Governemnt believes we will be unable to implement our policies adequately.\n\nThis upcoming election is sure to decide the direction of our nation's efforts in the years to come."

The early election called by our Government a month ago has concluded and the results are beginning to be tallied nation-wide.\n\nMany within our Government hope that another majority for the Conservative government will be returned as a means of showing public support for our harsh, but necessary, economic policies. There are whispers however that the election has not gone as we had foreseen, with many parties gaining popularity. The talk of the night regardless of the result is sure to be the Independent Labour Party, as either victory or defeat for them will decide their future in British politics.\n\nAs the results begin to pour in this election not only do MPs in the House of Commons stand with bated breath, but the average people of our country do as well."

As local residents peered out their windows they saw what could only be described as a liquid tsunami of beer careening down the road, over-turning several automobiles and damaging every bit of property in its path. Luckily the worst of the damage seems to have been some major downstairs flooding as the Beernami broke down numerous house doors.\n\nThe wave appears to have originated from Meux and Company Brewery, and upon further inspection of the site it appears that one of the large vats storing the beer shattered overnight creating a domino effect that released some 323,000 Imperial Gallons of beer onto the street.\n\nAs morning descends upon the area the remainder of the wave has dissipated, the only proof that it had ever existed being flooded homes, damaged automobiles and some very unhappy locals."

Recent political developments however allow us to decide whether or not the Union Jack should be replaced by the Royal Standard of the King-Emperor, or whether we should keep the flag that has become synonomous with the British Empire and its influence around the globe."
uk.60.d:0 "In 1916, during the height of the Great War in Europe, Irish Republicans and Nationalists launched a rebellion in Ireland. Today history refers to it as the Easter Rising, a rising which was ultimately crushed by British Armed Forces after almost a brutal week of fighting in Dublin and other areas of the country. The leadership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood - the organisation behind the uprising - were captured by British forces and on the urging of the Irish Parliamentary Party their trial was post-poned until after the Great War. This choice was to prove a mistake as time rolled on.\n\nIn the waning years of the Great War the remaining members of the IRB launched a surprise operation to free their leadership from imprisonment. The security forces in the area were easily overwhelmed and the IRB leadership freed.\n\nToday we stand at a precipice; for two decades the IRB has continued to cause chaos in Ireland through attacks on the RIC and local industry and infrastructure. With our integration efforts proceeding well there only remains the final issue of dealing with the IRB itself.\n\nOur choice here will matter to the Irish people and whether they will be satisfied with the political status quo throughout the immediate future or if they will continue to drift from our influence in the coming years, accompanied by the inevitable political fallout. The use of the British Armed Forces to crush the IRB is likely to succeed, but the Irish people will not stand for British military units on the streets of Ireland in an attempt to deal with what is effectively an Irish affair. Our other choice is to use the RIC, recently strengthened by the efforts of our Government, to capture and arrest the IRB leadership. This choice is less likely to succeed, but if it does it will go a long way in sending the message to Ireland that outside major affairs, Britain has no interest in continuous meddling in internal Irish issues. Our decision today is likely to determine whether or not Ireland will see a return to stability or if instability will turn to chaos."
uk.61.d:0 "As per orders early this morning British soldiers deployed to the streets of Ireland from North to South to temporarily impose order on towns and cities as the hunt for the IRB began in earnest. Local Irish onlookers gazed on in horror as seemingly a repeat of the Easter Rising took place.\n\nIn many towns and cities IRB elements refused to surrender and running gun battles erupted across busy streets, with numerous casualties on both sides. The conflict continued well into the night as fighting raged ferociously in Cork and Dublin. It was not until some time after dusk that the remaining IRB cells finally surrendered after more British reinforcements were called in.\n\nEarly reports indicate that the IRB leadership was tipped off by Irish locals working in the civil service who noticed new troop reinforcements flooding the region in preparation for what we have termed 'Operation Sabre'.\n\nWith the fighting over an uneasy peace has settled over Ireland. Many citizens are furious at British troops once more being deployed to major town and cities, but loyalists to Britain are simply happy that the IRB has once and for all been dealt with, their leadership having been either imprisoned or killed during the fighting."
uk.62.d:0 "Despite an immense presence by our Armed Forces throughout Ireland, when the British Army deployed to the streets this morning local commands immediately called the British Army HQ in Ireland with rather worrying reports.\n\nIt seems despite the utmost caution and secrecy in the preparation of this operation there has been an information leak. Rumours swirl of IRB infiltration at the top of Royal Intelligence Services in Ireland, with many formerly trust-worthy agents now under suspicion. Truthfully we may never find where the leak originated from, but we will have to deal with the consequences.\n\nThe IRB now knows we are closing on them and rapidly, after one close-call they may resort to rash acts over the coming months, we must be on our guard."
uk.63.d:0 "At dawn this morning Royal Irish Constabulary units deployed to the streets of several important towns and cities across the Irish isles in an attempt to once and for all deal with the IRB either through arrest, or if necessary, force.\n\nAs the morning progressed, RIC units succeeded in storming several previously hidden IRB cells throughout the nation, taking most of the IRB by surprise with only a small number of wounded reported, and no deaths. Many local Irish barely noticed the efforts of the RIC until the IRB leadership was carted out in cuffs to be transported for imprisonment once again. It appears that our trust in the RIC was well placed."
uk.64.d:0 "As the sun rose over Ireland this morning, Royal Irish Constabulary units deployed across the Irish isles in an attempt to capture and detain the IRB leadership. It was not long into the planned operation that reports began to indicate that something had gone horribly wrong.\n\nDespite the best efforts of local intelligence services, important information about today's operation apparently leaked into the hands of the IRB. As RIC units stormed several locations across the nation they found nothing, the IRB leadership having fled in advance. Despite this failure it would have been far worse had we opted to use our Armed Forces to crush the IRB.\n\nWith the IRB in hiding, it remains to be seen what will come of the organisation. Many Intelligence experts believe the IRB will bide their time opting to wait for a more sutiable opportunity to once again cause havoc in Ireland in an attempt to eject us from Ireland once and for all. Until then, the IRB remains their spectre hanging over both Ireland and Britain, what the future will bring is anyone's guess."
uk.65.d:0 "Early this morning urgent reports from RIC leaders and local military commanders began appearing in Royal Intelligence HQ in London, until one hour ago we had been struggling to make heads or tails of these reports, as many had simply indicated that they were under attack and others simply that they were 'engaging an enemy force'. Some rather bright young individuals in Intelligence quickly recognised a pattern that they had seen elsewhere in these attacks, it was very similar in the method used by the IRB during the Easter Rising of 1916.\n\nAs of this moment the IRB has seized numerous important Government buildings across Ireland, and de-seated many of our local military units in the West and South parts of the nation, effectively handing direct control over to the IRB. Military Units in Dublin are current engaged in defending against a large, but under-equipped, IRB force while more of the British Army rallies in the North and East of Ireland.\n\nAs of this moment the Second IRB Rising is on-going. If we are to ensure control over Ireland and our continued influence over this important strategic position we must crush this rebellion quickly, lest other Great Powers use this opportunity to further weaken our position."
uk.66.d:0 "It has been one year to the day since Royal Irish Constabulary units stormed several IRB cells across Ireland and successfully captured and imprisoned the IRB leadership pending trial. Since that time an uneasy peace descended over the Irish isles, but it has been followed by a sense of stability.\n\nIRB attacks have stopped, their remaining members going into hiding, and Irish civilians seem to be satisfied with how the situation was handled, without overwhelming force by the British Armed Forces, and without more blood on the streets. For now, Ireland seems content to accept the Status Quo as nominally part of Britain, but with a degree of autonomy. Whether or not this feeling will continue indefinitely is unknown, but for now at least the independence movement in Ireland has been dealt a serious blow."
uk.67.d:0 "With Westminster's efforts directed at granting independence to Ireland and officially separating it from direct control from London many changes have taken place across the Irish isles. A Parliament building has been established, and Irish citizens have began in earnest to debate the future of Ireland as a nation. It comes to us however, to determine the future relationship between our two nations as Ireland readies itself to join the world as a nation reborn.\n\nMany hawkish MPs in our Government have suggested that we cannot allow Ireland itself to drift further from our sphere of influence, and that while increased autonomy from London is necessary, we must draw the line so that Ireland will remain an ally of Britain. Simply put, we will direct our efforts to maintaining political control over Irish matters indirectly. There are also those within our Government that suggest that we should instead follow through on our promises; granting full independence to Ireland and allow them to choose their own path, whether it be with ourselves and the Empire or on their own, this choice being the height of liberty and freedom a nation can achieve.\n\nWhatever path we choose a new dawn is breaking over the Ireland and Britain, and the choice we make today will determine the relationship our two nations will have in the decades to come."
uk.68.d:0 "As our calamitous defeat in Ireland has sent shockwaves throughout our nation, the Provisional Irish Government has only gained in strength and international recognition. With the entirety of the Irish Isles now under their control they have pursued diplomatic channels with our nation in an effort to bring the war to and end.\n\nTheir demands are simple; the Irish Isles will be recognised as an independent republic free from British rule and the war between our two nations will come to an end. Our Government has laughed at such flagrant demands and plans are already in motion for the recapture of Ireland. Though some believe that perhaps after all these centuries the effort of controlling Ireland is simply no longer worth it."
uk.69a.d:0 "Much to the surprise of our nation the British Government has accepted our demands for peace and has formally requested negotiations over the peace deal between our two nations, with Westminster recognising that Ireland will from now on be an independent republic free from British control."
uk.69b.d:0 "The foolish British have refused our generous demand for peace between our two nations. Citing that Ireland 'will and forever be part of the United Kingdom' they have severed diplomatic back-channels between our two nations and made thinly veiled threats about future attempts to recapture our nation. We must prepare ourselves for the attack that is surely to come."
uk.70.d:0 "Today there was an attack on one of our industrial centres in Ireland. The terrorist organisation known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood has claimed the attack as one of their own. There have been no fatalities as a result of the attack, but some people are reported to have been seriously injured."
uk.71.d:0 "Those vile terrorists in the Irish Republican Brotherhood have today claimed a bombing attack on a major Irish Railway as their own. Two people have been reportedly killed with several others having sustained serious injuries. This attack has also put severe strain on the train lines in the region, causing major delays to both Passenger and Freight travel, as well as hindering movement of our military throughout the region."
uk.72.d:0 "Horrifying news has been reported today, as IRB members have been seen attacking and injuring members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. As of yet, no officers have thankfully been killed, but some have sustained serious injuries. These attacks are a threat to our control of Ireland, as we rely heavily on the RIC to deal with insurgent action and protests peacefully to prevent escalation. The Irish are now killing themselves."
uk.80.d:0 "As the revolt in India spirals quickly out of control, it has become clear to both our Government and the British Army Chief of General Staff that this rebellion will take a significant amount of time, equipment and manpower to put down efficiently, and even then we may not succeed. With this in mind several members of the House of Commons have put forward a proposal to force the Government to negotiate with the rebel leaders in an attempt to bring this rebellion to an end.\n\nThe proposals specify that Westminster will guarantee that Indian Autonomy will be increased at the upcoming Imperial Conference in 1937, and that a long-term plan for the total withdrawal of British troops from India will be put in place. Such a proposal is of course utterly ridiculous, but it may serve to placate those rebel leaders until such a time as we are more adequately prepared to deal with problem."
uk.81.d:0 "This morning a British Officer was found near the front-line in Western Bengal, apparently having approached a local militia position waving a white flag. While at first several of our Militia were elated at the possibility of British surrender, it seems the Officer was simply a messenger to deliver a note to the leaders of our rebellion. The note details a British proposal that they will grant increased autonomy for India at the Imperial Conference in 1937 and put forward plans for a total withdrawal of British troops from India in the long-term. Many within our leadership are sceptical that the British would actually follow through with such an agreement, but our military commanders are keen to remind us that while we have the advantage for the moment the British may soon bring the full wrath of the Empire down upon us, and that should they do so our revolt will surely be crushed."
uk.82.d:0 "Early this morning an Indian rebel delegation was received in Hyderabad to discuss the proposal put forward by our Government in recent days. The leaders made several ridiculous demands including an immediate withdrawal of British troops from India or they would 'liberate every square inch of India forcefully'. It seems there is no reasoning with these fools."
uk.84.d:0 "Our proposal for peace has been accepted by the rebel leaders in India. Apparently they were not as confident in their objectives as we were led to believe."
uk.85.d:0 "With our victory over the rebel forces a semblance of stability has returned to India, though many troubles still remain. In the coming years more challenges will appear, and we must forever stand at the ready to face them head on."
uk.88.d:0 "With the newly independent Indian nation in a state of total collapse the former administrators of the Raj have fled to Ceylon and set up a new administration on the island. While they do not openly lay claim to the Indian sub-continent, we may find them useful at a later date once we officially restore order to India."
uk.90.d:0 "Despite our efforts to appease the strikers of Manchester just last year, it appears yet another national strike has been called by the Miners’ Federation. Coal miners across the whole nation are on strike meaning little to no coal is being mined. While we do have vast reserves, they shall not last us too long. Thankfully, there is a purpose to this strike: the strikers demand we provide welfare payments to the unemployed. Accepting these demands would incur high costs to our already shattered economy, but our nation is highly dependent on coal still and so allowing this strike to continue is sure to have dire consequences later down the line."
uk.91.d:0 "Just as feared, our coal reserves are running dangerously low. There are now areas of the nation entirely without coal because of how cold this winter has been, meaning there has been an unusually high need for said coal that we have burnt our way through. This shortage has led to a large amount of unrest and protests demanding we end this strike within certain regions of the country."
uk.92.d:0 "His royal majesty King Edward VIII, has today visited the one of the coal mines on strike and has spoken openly about his sympathy with the miners and those affected by the shortages. Such a move has severely damaged our government’s legitimacy as even our King doubts our policies!"
uk.93.d:0 "The unrest in within regions of our country due to the shortage of coal has reached a critical level, once again many areas of the nation are paralysed by rioting of angry mobs of citizens calling for the Government to take affirmative action to solve the coal shortage. It is vital we take action soon, or else this situation shall only worsen if it carries on much longer."
uk.94.d:0 "A dire and unfortunate consequence of this coal shortage, during such a cold winter, is the gruesome fact of people freezing and ultimately dying from the cold. The number of deaths has been truly staggering, and many have once again gone straight to blaming us and our failure to resolve the issue as being the culprits of these deaths. Such an assertion is of course ridiculous, one must place blame on the strikers!"
uk.95.d:0 "After a gruelling and freezing cold winter, we have stood strong and have come out of the other side of these shortages and strikes. Once again, the strikers have capitulated and gone back to their work and once again the coal shall be mined and the people shall no longer suffer at the hands of selfish Socialist ideas, breaking their access to the warmth and heat they so desperately needed during this past winter. The cost for this strike was the lives of many civilians, and I hope those who went on strike know that they are truly the ones to blame for their deaths. We may accept some of the blame, but the majority rests of the shoulders of the selfish miners and their demands!"
uk.100.d:0 "As the Manchester Workers Crisis gripped the country, one thing was for certain: without the backing of the Trade Unions it surely would not have reached the heights that it did. Their treasonous support for radicals intent on bringing harm to the British people must not be forgiven.\n\nThe King has ordered a review into the purpose of the Trade Unions in our nation. Some of the more 'extreme' members of the Privy Council have begun advocating for the complete dissolution of the Trade Unions entirely to ensure they never again wield the power they once did. As a man or reason, the King is inclined to hear all sides over this issue, and perhaps by creating a state-led Trade Union we may control this power for ourselves and assist in alleviating the burdens of the common man."
uk.101.d:0 "As the King ascended to his rightful position as Head of our Nation the aristocracy supplied some of his most significant backers. Today they have requested that the King look into the role of the aristocracy in our nation, with many of these individuals craving power for themselves.\n\nAt the top of these proposals is allowing the aristocrats to manage regions in the Isles through local councils, loyal to the King himself of course, but capable of autonomy in certain affairs. Rightly derided as an attempt to revive feudalism in Britain, few take these proposals seriously, but the gain they could bring is perhaps enough to consider the idea after-all."
uk.102.d:0 "One of the King's most vocal supporters in recent months has been the Church of England. Recognising his great contribution to maintaining the status quo in Britain and acting as a bulwark against radicalism and unwanted change in our nation, the Church has thrown in their lot with the Monarchy. The King is himself a religious man, but is perhaps not as devout as amny suspect. In the coming days he has made notice that he will decide the future of the Church of England and its relation to the Government."
uk.103.d:0 "Established during the mid 17thC, the Household Cavalry Guards have played a significant role throughout British history in their guardianship of the Monarchy. Acting as an integral part of the King's intervention and resumption of power over the Kingdom, the Household Guard have since had their duties expanded greatly to ensure order.\n\nSeveral of the Commanders of this prestigious force have since approached the King and asked him to consider the expansion of the Household Cavalry Guard to ensure their efficiency in defending the King and his family. Behind closed doors some of the Commanders have hinted that they would like to see additional powers be granted to them to root out treasonous elements of British society. In the name of the King, of course."
uk.104.d:0 "Since the King's resumption of power the Privy Council has expanded greatly in size and in the influence that it wields. Before the Crisis it was filled with sycophantic yes-men who only wished to line their own pockets, but has since come to include men of Officers of the Armed Forces, Clergymen and Aristocrats. The King has now transfixed his gaze upon the Privy Council's composition, and an important decision is soon to be made regarding what sort of men he should look to for advice in running the nation."
uk.105.d:0 "Stability, peace, order and justice once more reign across Britain. Through the King's guiding hand Britain has escaped the death throes of revolution and emerged stronger than ever. Like rats setting upon a carcass however, the democratic politicians of the country have begun to emerge from their holes and speak of the King returning power to Parliament. All is forgiven they say, that the King simply used his royal prerogative to ensure Britain's safety. The King is however open to this overtures, as he is taken by the image of him being the 'saviour' of Britain and its people. Surely he must recognise the importance of his position, and that stability only exists due to his rule, and everything we have fought for will surely evaporate if he relinquishes control to those who brought us to the brink of disaster."
uk.106.d:0 "With the King once more establishing himself as guardian of the nation, the question has arisen as to who guards the King. As such a group of prominent patriots and monarchists have established a new Knighthood Order, the Order of the Crown, with the blessing of the King himself. Tasked with the defence of the King and his family, and in many ways acting similarly to the Household Cavalry Guard, the Order of the Crown will in many ways act as an security organisation equivalent to MI5, but with the Monarchy's protection at the top of their objectives."
uk.107.d:0 "Gravely concerned with the events occurring in the homeland during the Manchester Worker's Crisis, many of the Dominions were beset with worry that we would fall to radicalism. As stability once more has returned to Britain, the King has set out to tour the Empire and reassure those doubters that Britain has never been stronger than she is at this moment.\n\nStarting in Canada, the King will travel the width of the country by train, visiting many of the important cities along the way. Upon reaching Vancouver he will travel to New Zealand's capital for a week's stay before continuing on to Australia where he will meet with representatives of the Dominions personally and consult with them over the future of the Empire. Once concluded he will travel to the Raj, touring Calcutta before meeting the Governor-General in the Viceroy's House in New Delhi to discuss improving worker's conditions in the colony. Finally he will travel to South Africa and visit Pretoria before journeying to Cape Town where he will embark on a Royal Navy Battleship which will travel up the East Coast of Africa, and through the Suez Canal back to Britain.\n\nAn extensive trip, but one that is sure to improve morale throughout the Empire after this recent crisis."
uk.110.d:0 "''It is with great pride and commitment to my country and its people that I shall lead this brave nation forward with all the strength our nation harbours. Never again shall such terrible events as those that happened in Manchester ever plague this country again. Under my leadership all voices shall be heard, all ideas shall be observed! We shall create a truly great nation, and an even greater Empire!''\n\nThese were the words of - former Colonel, now General - Jack Churchill, who after observing recent weeks of chaos in our nation stepped in with support of the Armed Forces to restore order to Britain. The military intervention has saved this country from a collapse into the deathly arms of Collectivism, we must therefore thank the honourable men of the High Command and seek to repair the divisions created by this attempted revolution. It is time to rebuild Britain and safeguard her people from evil ideologues."
uk.111.d:0 "One thing has become clear in these past months following the end of the Manchester Worker's Crisis: the crisis would never have been able to reach the height that it did without interference from known provocateurs. The failure of the democratic governments preceeding our own rule are clear; they willingly allowed subversive elements to roam free on the streets of Britain and sow the seeds of discord in our nation, in order to secure ourselves from the possibility of further calamity we must establish a new organisation to root out the machiavellian elements of our great nation who only wish to see it destroyed.\n\nChurchill has thus far been careful to move forward with reforms to prevent further unrest, but he has placed special interest in the creation of the British Anti-Revolutionary Brigade (BARB) to secure our new Government and protect Britain from further harm. Poised to begin operations in a week's time, the BARB is comprised of mainly ex-military men whose loyalties are unquestionable. Today Jack stands at the ready to sign the BARB into law."
uk.112.d:0 "Churchill has proven himself significantly as a leader of Britain since taking power, not only with his command of the administration and willingness to impose swift justice against Britain's enemies, but also in his ability to see the bigger picture. Foremost of these is his criticism of Britain's current educational system which he regards as a serious contributory factor and root cause of the Manchester Worker's Crisis. Arguing that the schools are filled to the brim with radicals pouring poisonous lies into the minds of the British youth.\n\nOne of Jack's primary focus' in the past weeks has to been to devise a new plan for education for the British people, starting with a blanket reform of the current educational standards. Placing an emphasis on the rigours of physical training, patriotism to the State and people, as well as the importance of discipline these new reforms are likely to shake-up the entire educational system, with some comparing the proposals to the Spartan training methods of Ancient Greece. No doubt these new 'methods' are likely to bring a significant backlash from the British public in some regards, but Jack argues that the future of the British nation is at stake and with these new reforms the British youth will be armed and prepared to face revolution wherever it is found."
uk.113.d:0 "At the core of Churchill's proposals are plans to reinvigorate the British Army and bring it to the front as the defender of Britain. Strangled in recent years by incompetent politicians and their blatant ineptitutde, the British Army must be remade from within so that it can be stronger than ever before. Consulting with Generals of the Great War, Churchill has put together a package of reforms and funding that will significantly shake-up the British Army and make it the fighting force it was destined to be.\n\nInside these reforms lay several smaller clauses, most notably of which is a new handbook designed for the Infantryman of the British Army. Titled 'On Combat and the Nature of War', the pamphlet has been written by Jack Churchill himself, and pushes for a renewed emphasis being placed upon honour and gallantry in combat. The book begins not with an introduction but with a single quote: ''Any soldier who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed.''."
uk.114.d:0 "As the military leadership took rightful control over the governing of our fair nation, many of the old Government archives were investigated for material deemed excessively radical, and their creators placed on watch-lists. Of this material one particular plan was made note of by our current administration, labelled simply as Plan J by its previous owner, it advocated for the rapid mobilisation of British industry to meet war demands once it became clear that the Empire was on the path to conflict with another nation.\n\nOstensibly created in response to the dire predicament the Government of our nation found itself in during the opening years of the Great War, several important industrial leaders of our nation have already been made aware of Plan J and were scheduled to update the Government yearly on their planned preparations. Of these scheduled yearly updates, this year's appraisal was to occur within a week's time. With Jack's renewed interest in the mobilisation of Britain to defend itself against foreign invasion he has ordered the Industrial leadership of Britain to be summoned to Parliament to meet with him directly. It is expected that Churchill will give the order for Britain's industries to be placed on a 'heightened state of alert' to prepare for future conflict."
uk.115.d:0 "With our rule secure over the Government and order imposed on Britain's fair isles once more the time has arrived for us to determine the future of our nation and people. Military leaders have been meeting with Churchill regularly over the course of the past week as they attempt to flesh out a deal on what should be done with the current governing system, with many arguing that while the current military-rule brings stability to Britain that it cannot last forever. Their critics argue that allowing Britain to embrace democracy once more would only abdicate our responsbility to defend Britain from further harm, and that we have a moral obligation to continue to rule indefinitely. A man not noted for patience, Churchill has curiously stood by and let both sides argue it out for days, that was, until this morning.\n\nAs the leadership met once more to discuss what Britain's path should be, Jack placed forward his own proposals for Britain's political future. To ensure stability, order and justice in the coming years, the democratic system would be returned to Britain, but would be reformed significantly. Chiefly among these reforms would be that only those who had served the Armed Forces of Britain would be allowed to vote in any elections or run for political office. Simply referred to as 'citizens' this new class would decide the future of Britain, and weed out those who would be unfit for holding political office in the first place. Derided by some of the leadership as simply mad, others have been intrigued by the idea, and it may be the best way to solve the dispute once and for all."
uk.116.d:0 "As part of Churchill's British Army reforms new measures would have to be put in place regarding the prominence of the Royal Navy over the British Army in the defence of Britain. While Churchill recognised the enormous contribuion of the Royal Navy over the past centuries in the defence of Britain's shores, he firmly believes that it is the Royal Infantryman that will ultimately decide whether Britain lives or dies, whether it is on the fields of the home isles or in war overseas.\n\nAs such Jack has put forward new laws that will weaken the Royal Navy somewhat and transfer some of the technical resources available to the Admiralty to the command of the British Army, as well as the transfer of academics responsible for research into naval development to areas more useful to the British Army.\n\nFlatly opposed by the Admiralty, and likely to significantly harm our ability to modernise our Navy in the short term, it will provide a much needed injection to the British Army."
uk.120.d:0 "The effects of the London Market Collapse are an international problem, our financial assets were present in every major power and continent and so when the economy collapsed, so did these assets. Therefore, it has been suggested that we call an economic conference in London with the major powers of the world in order to reach an agreement on an international effort to tackle the effects of the London Market Collapse. The nations attending would be: The USA, Japan, France and Italy and at this conference we would form plans for combating the global depression, reviving international trade and stabilising currency exchange rates. It is sure to be a great help to the worldwide recovery."
uk.121.d:0 "The first issue to be raised at the conference was that of international trade. Due in part to our isolationist foreign policy, we have had a considerably high tariff on foreign goods in our country. The other nations are suggesting that everyone lowers their tariffs in order to encourage global trade, thus bolstering the economies of the world and in turn helping on the path to economic recovery."
uk.122.d:0 "Another issue that has been raised as this conference, is the issue of international debts owed by many nations – including some of the powers present today. While they do owe us a lot of money, in order to ensure a swifter recovery, it may be wise to simply remove any debts they have to us thus allowing them to focus their economy on their own internal recovery instead of paying off their international debt. Many within our government strongly advise us against doing this however, as the money earned from debt payments could be of great use to us in bolstering our own economy."
uk.123.d:0 "The Pound Sterling is the dominant currency of the modern world, it stands as the universal currency and as such the exchange rate of other currencies is compared against it. Therefore, in order to secure a stable global economy, it is vital that the value of the pound be stabilised. The London Market Collapse has caused major inflation in many sectors of our economy, and the world economy, therefore it may be wise to begin deflating the value of the pound in order to bring about more stability. Some economists argue though, that doing such a thing may lead to further instability as our previously inflating currency begins suddenly deflating, causing major uncertainty within the markets and as such damaging economic confidence even further. They therefore argue, that we should fix the value of the pound at a higher rate than it is currently, thus preventing any further inflation and properly stabilising the value of the pound."
uk.125.d:0 "While our nation prepares for total war with our new enemy, it seems that dissent has begun to stir within our own nation. The Irish Republican Brotherhood, a persistent thorn in our sides ever since the Great War, has organised a large-scale revolt in Ireland against our rule. Local garrisons in Cork and Dublin are being overrun by irregular troops and some highly professional soldiers, stoking fears that this rebellion is sponsored from abroad. Whether or not this is true matters not, what matters is that our enemies now have the perfect opportunity to strike indirectly at our nation. We must use all of our power to restore order to Ireland immediately, lest our foes establish a foothold in Ireland."
uk.130.d:0 "With the Imperial Conference of '37 having ended just two years ago, it seems as though a life-time has passed since its conclusion. Monumentous decisions were made and the resulting aftershocks are still being felt throughout the Empire and the greater part of the world.\n\nThis year's conference, by comparison, is less eventful. The primary concerns that are likely to be raised are territorial situations throughout the Empire and the nominal status of several Dominions throughout.\n\nFirstly the Canadian delegation is expected to raise the issue of Newfoundland, as its government has been faltering over the past few years and the Canadians themselves see this as a ripe opportunity to formally integrate the territory into their nation. Secondly, the South African delegation is likely to propose that the territory of Rhodesia and Bechuanaland be formally integrated into the Union of South Africa. Finally, we must discuss the current global situation that is seen by many as deteriorating rapidly, and the preparations that may be necessary to ensure our prepardeness for war."
uk.131.d:0 "As expected, the Canadian delegation has wasted no time in raising the issue of Newfoundland at this year's conference. Lambasting the Newfoundlander administration for failing to meet the expectations of their people and deliberately making the situation worse to satisfy their own greed, the Canadians have demanded that we exercise our Imperial authority to either dissolve the Newfoundlander Dominion or integrate it into Canada.\n\nThe Newfoundlanders have issued a stern rebuke of what they have called attempts at Canadian imperialism, threatening to organise protests if Newfoundland is forcefully integrated into Canada. This issue must be handled delicately, or we risk further instability within the Empire."
uk.132.d:0 "Before representatives of the different parts of the Empire were set to meet today to discuss the issue of potential war in Europe and abroad, our Government was approached by the Australian delegation in secret to discuss a matter of interest, that they wished for the time being to remain secret. After explaining their suggestion to the Government, it became apparant to all involved as to why they desired secrecy. The Australian representatives have proposed a formal merger of the Australian and New Zealand Dominions into a single 'Dominion of Oceania', citing the tense situation in Asia and the Pacific as their reasoning, as well as their belief that should it go to a referendum that the New Zealanders would vote to join Australia.\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of this proposal, formally integrating New Zealand into Australia is likely to generate a great deal of issues between the two Dominions. Our Government therefore believes the best course of action is to ask the New Zealanders to hold a referendum on the matter to determine their fate."
uk.133.d:0 "With two major issues out of the way, we move to perhaps the most serious issue present at this years conference: the issue of current global instability. Many within our Government believe that this current period of global instability may continue for at least several more years, and that as such we must ready the Empire as a whole to be prepared for war with others. While such a notion is prudent, it would prove deeply unpopular. The Empire is still largely recovering from the effects of the London Stock Collapse, and the people may resist attempts at militarisation or partial mobilisation of our economies. We should also consider that such a move may seem provactive towards any nation that regards us as a future enemy, therefore worsening the global situation itself.\n\nProponents of Isolation have flatly rejected such a proposal, arguing that the Empire should do all that she can to avoid entanglement in another war similar to the Great War."
uk.134.d:0 "Now that the Fifteenth Imperial Conference comes to a close, only a single issue remains to be addressed: the status of Rhodesia within the Empire. The Union of South Africa has officially tabled a proposal for a referendum in Rhodesia on whether or not they should join the South African Dominion. The Rhodesian representatives have not rejected the proposal, instead stating that they will follow the will of their people on the matter, seemingly offering us a green light regarding a referendum on the subject in Rhodesia.\n\nIf such a referendum were victorious it would also likely mean that the Bechuanland territory would also join the Union of South Africa. If successful, the Dominion of South Africa would be present a far stronger force in Africa, however it may lessen their reliance on the homeland for protection in the future."
uk.135.d:0 "This year's Imperial Conference has concluded successfully. Some important issues were dealt with this year although it remains to be seen what their ultimate affect will be on both the Dominions involved and the Empire as a whole. For now though, the Empire is unlikely to see major change until the next Conference in two years time."
uk.140.d:0 "It has been barely a month since our new Government formed between Labour and the ILP and already things have begun to destabilise. Angered by Clement Attlee's willingness to compromise with our party, several hard-liners of his party have begun calling for his removal. This situation would normally be ignored as the simple bickering of the back benchers, but instead is noted by the marked silence of his supporters.\n\nSo far the only MP who has stood tall to defend Attlee's position has been the young Oswald Mosley, current Chancellor of the Exchequer. It remains to be seen whether this support will hold up to the continued assault by angry MPs in the coming weeks."
uk.141.d:0 "Rumours swirl in the halls of Westminster as MPs belonging the Independent Labour Party have held a series of closed-door meetings in recent weeks. Apparently unwilling to allow this sort of foul play to affect the running of the Government, Prime Minister Greenwood has reached out to Mosley to speak with the dissenters in an attempt to limit their destabilising actions and bring order to the Government.\n\nWhile the Prime Minister did not expect to see these issues ended overnight, he was deeply troubled by the report from Mosley once he had returned. Supposedly the rebel MPs belonging to his party have garnered enough support to push for a vote of no confidence over Attlee's leadership of the party. The results are likely to become public in the next two weeks."
uk.142.d:0 "As expected, the vote of no confidence took place secretely between ILP MPs and has resulted in the ousting of Attlee. While many were concerned about the potential instability in our Government until the ILP found a new leader, a fresh leadership election was apparently called almost immediately after the no confidence vote, a demand made specifically by Mosley.\n\nUp until this point we had reason to believe that Oswald had been a firm supporter of Attlee for pragmatic reasons, but it appears they were purely selfish political motives. While in public Mosley was endorsing Attlee as leader of the ILP, in secret he was the one pushing for the vote of no confidence while simulataneously positioning himself to be the next leader of the ILP. With no other clear candidate to take over, and with many of our own MPs concerned about instability in the Government, we have had no choice but to accept the new turn of affairs much to our own chagrin."
uk.143.d:0 "Since the rise of Mosley to power in the ILP rapid changes have begun taking place within the party with the purpose being to centralise power to Mosley's position. More worringly, several of the more 'radical' members of our party have in recent days been meeting with Mosley in private, with many suspecting attempts to sway them to the ILP side in an effort to topple our control over the coalition, and instead place it in the hands of Mosley and the ILP.\n\nFor now these rumours are just that, rumours, but many of our party are growing increasingly worried about the aggressive acts by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and whose new-found power has led him to call for bolder and bolder reforms each week."
uk.144.d:0 "Late last night, the Prime Minister sat alone in his office finishing up important Government work well into the night. Having not spoken to Mosley for almost a week, many believed he was drafting a letter in an attempt to patch up poor relations between himself and his Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nAs Greenwood continued on into the dark night, he consumed his late night tonic in an effort to stay awake. It would not take long before his mouth ran dry and his heart felt pain from the crushing feeling in his chest. An hour after he lay sprawled unconscious on the carpeted floor of his office."
uk.145.d:0 "Due to the diligent actions of his secretary, the PM has in recent weeks been recovering slowly in hospital after what Doctors have diagnosed as heart failure. While the cause is still unknown, many have suspected that the recent stressful weeks of inside the Government led to the accident.\n\nSurprisingly one of his first visitors was the man he had not spoken with in weeks, Chancellor Mosley. Appearing early into his recovery Mosley approached the PM and offered him his promises that the ILP would ceaase attempts to upset the political status quo inside the Government, and instead act in the benefit of the people of Britain."
uk.146.d:0 "With the death of the PM, a vacuum of power has emerged inside the Labour Party and Government as a whole. Rebel MPs within our Party have continuously thwarted efforts to select a new leader of the Party to replace the late Arthur Greenwood. More worringly is the news that many high-profile MPs within Labour have been meeting with Mosley in order to discuss the possibility of defecting to the ILP, as they are concerned over the lack of clarity in our Party's rule over the nation. Such a change would likely have severe ramifications for our Government, if enough MPs switch to the ILP it is likely to put the balance of power further into the hands of Mosley."
uk.147.d:0 "Early this morning Mosley appeared in the Commons to make a statement regarding recent political developments within both Labour and the ILP. Speaking of his concern regarding the instability in the Government, and his willingness to do whatever was necessary to ensure its continued existence, he announced that some three dozen MPs from our Party would join the ILP in the coming weeks.\n\nOur worst fears have been realised, while Labour is still formally in a coalition with the ILP, our power has been significantly weakened and therefore our ability to push for reforms that we choose. What's more, many expect this to continue in the coming weeks as more MPs cross over to the ILP in an attempt to stay relevant. Plummeting opinion polls have shown deep disfavour for our Government, with only Mosley remaining relatively unscatched by the entire affair. With his new position as head of the largest party in the coalition Government Mosley has moved forward with a cabinet reshuffle and been made the new Prime Minister by majority vote in Parliament."
uk.148.d:0 "One week has passed since the now Prime Minister Mosley took power over our new Government. Rapidly, change is beginning to be felt within the halls of Westminster. Politicians and civil servants run busily through its corridoors as new orders are passed down almost every hour by the new PM. Despite the circumstances of his victory, many have found themselves at least content that the past instability is now over. Though many were concerned about Mosley's plans for the Government in the future, their fears were allayed this morning as the PM took to Parliament to hold a live radio broadcast to the nation.\n\nSpeaking of the great task ahead of the British people in both securing their destiny and in allaying their current problems in the wake of the London Stock Market Crash, Mosley reassured those within our Government and country that the path this Government is on is the correct path to ensure the prosperity and peace of Britain and its Empire. Lambasting previous Governments for their failure to adequately predict the rhythm of this new age, he called upon Britons everywhere - regardless of their political inclinations - to work for the benefit of all of Britain, to ensure that their countrymen receive the quality of life that this new age allows, and that they deserve."
uk.149.d:0 "While our Government has remained relatively stable and free of the typical criticism that is weakly thrown at it by the Opposition, we have with our actions made an opponent of the King himself. Angered by the apparent rapid change made by our Government and the strides towards true socialism that we have promised the people of Britain, King Edward VIII has spoken at length in public to denounce the actions of Mosley and our Government. This exchange of words has only continued as Mosley has accused many of what he calls 'reactionaries' of inhibiting progress in our nation.\n\nIt is unlikely that these two men will ever see eye-to-eye, and this exhcange of comments is likely to be a hallmark of our Government in the years to come."
uk.150.d:0 "Long a staunch adversary in preventing Mosley from passing needed reforms, the House of Lords has been particularly effective in delaying all of our new legislation in recent weeks. The Prime Minister has since considered plans in coordination with his cabinet for a proposed House of Lords reform, where the new Upper House would be representative, rather than hereditary in nature. Such reforms are likely to see strong opposition from entrenched and outdated politicians, but will likely see a modicum of support among the British populace. Whatever our choice, the reality is that the status quo cannot continue."
uk.151.d:0 "With the newly reformed Upper House being moved towards being representative, we have seen a fresh wave of elections take place across the British Isles to fill these new democratic positions. The Government's first real litmus test on how the public perceives their actions in recent months, the results have been beyond expectation. The ILP has gained a complete majority in this new Upper House, returning well beyond half the total number of seats, with its current coalition partner barely receiving a dozen positions.\n\nThese results have allowed Mosley to further restructure our Government to consolidate power unto himself and the ILP, thereby strengthening our position greatly over the Governemnt."
uk.152.d:0 "Labour is but a shadow of its old self. Ever since the death of the late Arthur Greenwood and the defection of dozens of MPs to the ILP, Labour has floundered and struggled with in-fighting, they do however still maintain a strong hold over our Government and as such Mosley has recently met with his closest political allies to discuss his choices.\n\nIn order to further control our Government and the direciton that it takes, Mosley has decided to move forward with a secretive plan that will place ILP-aligned ministers into greater positions of power in the Labour Government. While still nominally a democratic decision, these new influential members of Labour are more willing to see eye-to-eye with Mosley and his policies, and will thus allow greater cooperation for the benefit of Britons in the future."
uk.153.d:0 "Since taking power resistance to our new reforms has been shown in several departments, not least of all in the Military, where the grumbling of upper-class officers grows daily. In order to rectify this issue, Mosley has reached out to his most prominent opponents to assuage their fears over the path Britain is now taking by offering to meet them at his office in 10 Downing Street.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will exactly be discussed at this meeting, assuming the meeting takes place at all."
uk.154.d:0 "It has taken well over a day of constant discussion but Mosley has succeeded in persuading several of his opponents to his way of thinking. Trouble still remains however, as some half dozen of his staunchest critics have refused to listen to his demands, arguing that if they are to continue that they would consider strongly the possibility of resistance to Mosley's Government.\n\nShocked by these recent developments, Mosley has met with his closest allies and determined that the only course of action in response to these threats to the democratically elected Government of Britain is to deal with these traitors."
uk.155.d:0 "A policy of prime importance to Mosley and the ILP is the nationalisation of many important companies in the British Isles and across the Empire. These industries are of firm importance to Britain and her people and cannot be allowed to remain in the hands of a few profiteering fat-cats. Mosley is in agreement, the Government is in agreement, these new companies must be state-run to ensure our continued prosperity into the future."
uk.156.d:0 "Late this afternoon Prime Minister Mosley held a live radio address to the people of Britain from his office at 10 Downing Street. Speaking at length of the challenges that Britons have overcome in recent months, and of the challenges that still lay ahead he congratulated the ability of Britons to adapt to the new age in which we live and to carry on as they always have.\n\nOffering a glimpse into his future plans for Britain and the Empire, Mosley argued that he would not allow Britain to be dragged into another disastrous war overseas unless Britain herself were at threat. With crisis brewing on the continent, many were relieved to hear that Britain itself would remain outside of the conflict in Europe. For now at least."
uk.160.d:0 "With war between ourselves and France now well underway the various colonies of both of our Empires across the globe have found themselves engulfed in the struggle between our two nations. Perhaps worst of these is our colony in Burma which we had normally relied upon the Raj Government to defend.\n\nDue to the uprising that was only recently dealt with in India we had seen fit to administer Burma directly to bring temporary stability to the region, but now with the Raj once more stable it would seem prudent to once more place Burma into their care in order to assist in the defence of the region from the threat of French Indochina."

#AA Oil Company
ukf.1.d:0 "With our eyes now cast on the Arabian peninsula and Parliament fully supportive of attempts to regain our influence over the Arabian nation, the choice has come to us to decide how it may be done. Many in our Government believe that an easier way of ensuring our control over the nation is to economically dominate it as was done in the inter-war period. As such, several of our ministers have suggested that we establish an Anglo-Arabian Oil Company. The benefits of doing so will be two-fold: firstly we will no doubt gain from any resource deposits discovered in the region, and secondly the Arabian Government will be unlikely to resist us with so much of their economy under our control. Our Government is prepared immediately to move forward with this venture."
ukf.2.d:0 "With the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company officially set up our Government must now decide the level of control we will have over the company. Many within our Government believe that with such an expensive and potentially lucrative venture we must maintain total control over the company. Others believe that by sharing control with the Arabian Government we may make them more willing to give in to our own demands."
ukf.3a.d:0 "The British Government has informed us of their decision regarding control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company. From now on they will maintain total control over the venture."
ukf.3b.d:0 "The British Government has informed us of their decision regarding control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company. They have decided to share control of the company with our Government in an effort to improve relations between our nations."
ukf.4.d:0 "Barely a week has passed since the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company set up near a promising area, and already problems have begun to manifest themselves. While the Arabian Government seems more than happy to allow our continued investment into their economy, it seems they do not have total control over the tribes in the area.\n\nLate yesterday afternoon several tribal members attacked our drill site, and wounded two British citizens before absconding with important equipment. This loss of face only serves to humiliate our nation, and we must see that it does not occur again."
ukf.5.d:0 "This morning the British delegation to our Government issued a series of demands to our Government. Citing the recent skirmish in Damman where a British citizen was wounded and equipment stolen from the drill site, they have demanded that they be allowed to station soldiers in the area and cede authority to the British in the region. Faced with such a demand our King does not feel it likely that he can accept these demands and survive the political intrigue after. As such, our options are limited."
ukf.6.d:0 "Unwilling to blindly accept our demands, the Arabian King has instead abdicated from his position. Using our influence over their Govenrnment we have succeeded in manuevering a more sympathetic member of the Royal Family into the position of King. He has accepted our demands over the Arabian Government and we have now found ourselves with a loyal protectorate in the region."
ukf.7.d:0 "The Arabian Government has refused our demands that we be allowed station soldiers near Damman to defend our drilling site. With a nation such as Arabia refusing our gracious demand, there is little option left but to show the world what happens when you refuse to accept the Empire's demands."
ukf.8.d:0 "Following the incident near Damman where a British citizen was wounded by local tribesmen and important equipment stolen from the dig site, the British Govenrment has demanded that our Government step up our efforts to defend their citizens on the ground. While this is of course possible, should we wish to try and remove British influence over our nation we can instead approach the local tribal leaders and offer them weapons as a means of stepping up attacks against the British. Such an act however, is likely to only make the British Government angrier."
ukf.9.d:0 "As the Arabian Government bowed to our pressure to reinforce the local garrison near our drilling site, an excursion was conducted to 'pacify' the area. Reports this morning indicate that the operation was a success and that we need no longer worry about the local tribes any longer."
ukf.10.d:0 "Despite our demands that the Arabian Government step up efforts to defend our drillrs from attack by local tribesmen, it has been reported to us that the local garrison has done little to assist in defence, and has according to at least one of our men on the ground, only aided those attacking the drill site. This situation reached a head this morning, as several of our oil drillers were killed in a recent raid by the tribesmen."
ukf.11.d:0 "It has been two weeks since the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company began drilling in earnest and initial results are encouraging. Large desposits of oil have been detected, several of our drillers on the ground have enquired as to the possibility of additional funding and resources being diverted their way. They say that with the extra money they can increase the output of the oil fields significantly."
ukf.12.d:0 "It has been a month since the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company began its successful drilling venture, and the results have been more than we could have hoped for. Previously untapped oil has been located in major quantities throughout our nation, though our hold over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company remains limited. As such our Government has proposed that we offer the British the Jordan and West Iraqi territories as a means of gaining additional control over the Company, and increasing the benefits it has for our nation."
ukf.13.d:0 "This morning the Arabian delegation in London has put forward an official proposal by their Government that would see additional control over the lucrative Anglo-Arabian Oil Company be put in their hands. In return they have offered us control over the Jordan and West Iraqi regions currently under their administration. While worthless, these territories would be useful for running our planned Cape to Calcutta railway system through, and increase our influence over the Levant."
ukf.14a.d:0 "The British Government has responded to our proposal and relinquished additional control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company to our nation in return for our Jordanian and West Iraqi territories."
ukf.14b.d:0 "The British Government has refused our generous proposal for additional control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company in return for Jordan and West Iraq."

#East Indies Blockade
ukf.20.d:0 "The question of Anglo-Dutch relations has recently come to the front in our Governmental plans for the future. With the situation on the continent deteriorating rapidly, it would be highly beneficial for us to ensure our continued dominance over the East Asian area. \n\nIn particular the East Indies remains a vital territory, containing some of the most vital resources for the war effort, notably its rubber production. Local viceroys and colonial governors in the region have come to us and expressed concerns over the situation in East Asia as well, with fears that the East Indies will become a war-zone in any future conflict. It would be extremely beneficial not only to the Empire as a whole, but also to stability and security in our East Asia holdings if we were to assume control over the Dutch East Indies. Such a demand however, is not likely to be received positively."
ukf.21.d:0 "This morning the British representative in Amsterdam handed our Government an official note. This document - a series of demands by the British Government - detailed the rather outrageous proposition that we deliver our East Indies possessions to them, as in their words 'the situation in the Pacific is tense', they omit of course than any tension is caused by their recent imperialistic efforts\n\nDelivering the East Indies to their control would likely severely damage our economy as many important resources are still mined and transported to our mainland from the area. This is to of course say nothing of the potential political ramifications of allowing the British Government to bully our nation into submission.\n\nDespite those that say defending the East Indies from any possible invasion is impossible, it seems we are left with little choice but to at least make an attempt to defend our interests in the East Indies."
ukf.22.d:0 "Quite to the surprise of our Government the Dutch have folded to our demands and have relinquished control over the East Indies. The process of transferring control to the Empire will begin in earnest over the coming days as the Dutch withdraw from the region entirely. We do not expect there to be much resistance to this new state of affairs. At least for the time being."
ukf.23.d:0 "Now that we have control over the East Indies, we must now decide how best to administer the territory. While direct control is the most obvious choice, it may be beneficial to our already stretched administration to divide the Islands up between our allies while keeping the major islands for ourselves."
ukf.24.d:0 "Our most noble ally in Britain has offered us a portion of land in the newly acquired East Indies. This offer is truly a great opportunity for us to expand our influence over the Pacific, and is resource rich land. Denying such an offer would be insanity!"
ukf.25.d:0 "The Dutch have unfortunately reacted as predicted to our demands for their East Indies colonies by refusing them out-right. In return, we have been presented with numerous methods of 'coercing' the Dutch, using the strength of the Royal Navy as a means of pressuring them into acceptance. The Admiralty has therefore put forward a plan for the total blockade of Dutch shipping to the East Indies, as a means of cutting off their colonial holdings in East Asia from their mainland, preventing supply and reinforcement. Any blockade over the area will likely be difficult and time-consuming, the East Indies are vast and we will need to free up many ships to patrol the area.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, as well as the acknowledgement that the Dutch are unlikely to take this lying down, many within our Government are insisting we drop the matter now as a means of salvaging our relations, the more hawkish members however are advocating that we prepare for a war in East Asia as a means of showing the world the price you pay for defying the Empire."
ukf.26.d:0 "Reports from the East Indies report a large blockade of the entire island chain is being conducted by the Royal Navy. The British Government has clearly given way to insanity - if we do not act now our colony will surely collapse and we will be subject to international humiliation! We should dispatch a squadron of our vessels immediately to break this blockade!"
ukf.27.d:0 "After tremendous pressure has been applied against the Dutch with our continued naval blockade of the East Indies, the Government in Amsterdam has opted to surrender to the Empire's control over the territory. Henceforth the East Indies is now totally under our dominion."
ukfa.28.d:0 "With our orders in place, our Naval Command in Amsterdam dispatched a large squadron of vessels to our East Indies territories with the intention of breaking the blockade. The journey was without issue, and it was not until we closed to within the Royal Navy blockade that things took a turn for the worse. Several of our ships were caught off-guard by Royal Navy battery fire due to poor weather in the area, in the initial salvo we lost two vessels, with one more being seriously damage. The ensuing battle was a long, drawn out skirmish in which our ships were gradually overwhelmed as more Royal Navy reinforcements arrived. Our Navy fought bravely, but in the end they could not breach the blockade. Most of the ships sustained heavy damage and many were sunk, resulting in a terrible loss of life. We have suffered a grave defeat this day, and our losses will not only be measured in lives and vessels, but also in overseas possessions."
ukfb.28.d:0 "Our navy, that we dispatched recently to break the blockade of the East Indies, encountered the British Navy off of Christmas Island earlier today. As the two forces clashed, and shells were fired, many ships were sunk and lives were lost however as the battle raged, our glorious navy carried on undeterred by their superior foe and managed to rout them from the battle, forcing them back to port. We have broken the blockade and the dominance of the Royal Navy has been shattered!"
ukfa.29.d:0 "Our blockade of the East Indies came under attack recently, as the Dutch Asia Fleet encountered our own Asia Fleet off of Christmas Island. Despite our number advantage, our ships came under sustained heavy shelling and suffered extensive damage. They were eventually forced, after a day of fighting, to return to port thus temporarily breaking the blockade. This has been a truly humiliating event for our nation, but we shall avenge this battle!"
ukfb.29.d:0 "Our blockade of the East Indies came under attack recently, as the Dutch Asia Fleet encountered our own Asia Fleet off of Christmas Island. Thanks to our superior tactics and enormous numbers advantage, we successfully smashed the Dutch fleet, sinking or damaging all of them and preserving the blockade. Our dominance of the Indian Sea has been maintained and the Dutch shall learn never to contest our power on the seas!"
ukf.30.d:0 "With our failure at the Battle of Christmas Island the blockade of our East Indies possessions has continued unabated. Supplies have run low, and the local population is growing restless; the UK has been successful in cutting us off from our East Indies territory. If we do not act soon our loyal soldiers will be forced to surrender, and the British will be able to occupy the islands without issue."
ukf.31.d:0 "With the failure of the Dutch Government at the Battle of Christmas Island our blockade has continued unabated. Royal Intelligence has indicated that supplies have begun to run low among the Dutch garrisons and the local populace has grown restless. The Dutch must be aware of this situation, and so it may be wise to offer them surrender now. Alternatively we may wait it out for an additional few weeks until the garrison surrenders unconditionally, and so that we may occupy the area without resistance."
ukf.32.d:0 "The British Government, apparently aware of our supply difficulties in the East Indies, has once again offered our Government the opportunity to surrender the islands to their control without further loss of life. While many within our Government are still strongly opposed to surrender, it seems that without a direct declaration of war against the Empire we will be unable to hold onto the territory indefinitely."
ukf.33.d:0 "Late yesterday evening elements of the Dutch Garrison stationed at Batavia officially surrendered to the British Admiral in charge of the Royal Navy blockade of the territory. Already elements of the Royal Marines have moved ashore and begun seizing Dutch administrative buildings in order to further cement the new reality: that the East Indies is now totally under the control of the British Empire."

#Operation Pitcairn
ukf.35.d:0 "The Panama Canal has connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans since 1914, making the flow of trade across the world much smoother and efficient, therefore the Canal is absolutely vital in maintaining our control over the seas. With the United States still suffering greatly from the Depression we have the perfect opportunity to take control over it.\n\nThere are two ways of gaining control over the Canal; we can either take advantage of the relatively small garrison stationed at the Panama Canal and prepare to land a contingent of Royal Marines on the canal, with orders to dislodge any American soldiers they find. Alternatively, we could also approach them with an offer to buy the Canal thus keeping us in good stead with the rest of the world, but costing us an enormous amount of money."
ukf.36.d:0 "The British representative in Washington today handed our Government an official proposal for the purchase of the Panama Canal. While such a suggestion would normally be disregarded entirely, as the Canal is regarded as being of strategic importance to our nation, there are some within our Government who are voicing interest in the agreement as a means of alleviating financial difficulties we are currently enduring due to the Great Depression."
ukf.37.d:0 "Our proposal for the purchase of the Panama Canal was agreed upon this morning by the British representative in Washington and the United States' Secretary of State. In the coming days the Panama Canal will officially exchange hands and the flow of money to the US in return for the canal will begin in earnest."
ukf.38.d:0 "In a display of utter stupidity, the American Government has out-right refused to our proposal for the purchase of the Panama Canal, stating that they could not wantonly allow the canal to be given to another nation, especially given its importance to trade in the Caribbean Sea. Many within our Government are furious at the Americans unwillinginess to listen to reason, and several hawkish members are suggesting that we use the strong arm of the Royal Navy to secure the Panama Canal without American approval."
ukf.39.d:0 "With our orders in place elements of the Royal Marines and Royal Navy have gathered in Whitehall to discuss the planned seizure of the Panama Canal from the US garrison currently stationed there. Codenamed 'Operation Pitcairn' - in honour of a Royal Marines officer killed during the Battle of Bunker Hill against American rebels - the planning will take several weeks to conclude and will possibly require a greater number of men and resources before we are fully ready. Already the first issue has arisen regarding the planned operation: Royal Marine commanders are adamant that they be given a greater number of soldiers, arguing that the current numbers are barely adequate to seize a territory as large as the Panama Canal.\n\nWe are confident that the Royal Marines will be able to succeed in securing this territory with relative ease, but we should be prepared should the worst happen."
ukf.40.d:0 "Yesterday evening Royal Navy Admirals reported to operational headquarters in Whitehall that there have been several intelligence issues regarding the Panama Canal. Supposedly the garrison of the area is much larger than previously anticipated and there are several geographical issues that may impede any proposed landing by the Royal Marines. As such they have requested that our Government give the go-ahead for an additional reconnaissance sweep of the Canal Zone in oreder to gleen more relevant intelligence over the area."
ukf.41.d:0 "It has been just over a month since Operation Pitcairn was ordered to be put into the planning stage and the men of the Royal Navy and Marines have been working tirelessly over the course of several long days and nights to prepare our Armed Forces for the upcoming capture.\n\nPractise landings were conducted over the past month across the British Isles in preparation for the assault, and the Royal Navy has moved a squadron of their vessels to the Caribbean. The Operation is almost ready to begin, it is simply a matter of time."
ukf.42.d:0 "At 5.34am local time, detachments of the Royal Marines made ground in the Panama Canal using the early morning fog to advance quickly ashore. Locals were awoken as shouts went out to half asleep American soldiers being woken from their beds and ordered to surrender in barracks across the zone.\n\nWhile initially successful firefights later erupted inland as the American garrison received orders to 'resist foreign invasion by any and all means'. Outnumbered and outgunned, the Americans fought bravely but in vain, as the guns of the Royal Navy were brought to bear on stubborn hold-outs in the territory.\n\nFighting has since ended and several hours of relative calm have passed in the Canal, with several hundred American soldiers captured. Washington has already responded with fury at our capture of the territory, stating that the '...attack represents the clearest example of renewed imperialism in the Americas by the British Empire'. It remains to be seen whether anything will come of this attack and whether or not the American government are willing to go to war over the territory."
ukf.43.d:0 "Early this morning as detachments of Royal Marines landed on the beaches of the Panama Canal zone they found themselves immediately set upon by a larger-than-predicted American garrison in the region, apparently alerted to our invasion far in advance.\n\nFighting bravely on the beaches of the territory, the Royal Marines - with the assistance of the Royal Navy - initially overwhelmed the defences of the American garrison before falling short of their primary objectives due to lack of supplies and poor knowledge of the local terrain. Forced into a stalemate by the American defenders the Royal Marines commanders ordered a general retreat after having captured a small port facility.\n\nThe cost of failure has been high: several hundred Royal Marines lay strewn across the Panama Canal with dozens more captured. With this loss of face our humiliation was only increased when American newspapers showed images of captured Royal Marines servicemen on their front pages."
ukf.44a.d:0 "At roughly 6am local time, reports began to come in from the Panama Canal regarding an assault by a heavily armed and specially trained force of soldiers. While details were scarce about who the attackers were, one of our Destroyers spotted a squadron of Royal Navy vessels off the coast of the Panama Canal providing fire support for what we assume to be a contingent of Royal Marines. Despite fighting bravely, our soldiers and sailors eventually succumbed to the more well-equipped Royal Marines.\n\nThe Press were gathered at the White House earlier today and the President made a statement regarding the assault, stating unequivocally that we would not allow the British to once again bring the spectre of imperialism to the Americas. While public opinion is firmly in favour of our Government in the matter, some doubt that the public is fully behind a war with the British Empire. Whatever our response is, we must choose carefully."
ukf.44b.d:0 "As the dawn began to rise over the Panama Canal this morning reports began to emerge of a heavily armed force wading ashore on the beaches of the Canal zone. Alerted by the local populace, our garrison in the area quickly moved to defend the territory and caught the attackers off-guard while they were still taking the beaches. A brutal firefight ensued and for a time it seemed as though our forces were on the brink of defeat before the enemy force was bogged down by lack of supplies and poor knowledge of the terrain.\n\nThe commander in the region ordered a general counter-attack against the beleagured attackers and forced them, once more, back to the breach from whence they came. A stalemate ensued as the attacking force dug in and launched their own vicious counter-attack which our brave soldiers repelled.\n\nAs the hours moved forward, the enemy force began to thin in numbers until only a few dozen remained on the beaches and surrendered to our soldiers, revealing themselves to be Royal Marines of the British Armed Forces.\n\nSome several hundred lay dead among the Canal Zone, and our Press has made much of the attack, parading images of the captured Royal Marines on their front pages. This entire affair has been a stark humiliation for the British Government and their imperialistic attempts to seize land unlawfully in the Americas."

#Channel Exercises

ukf.70.d:0 "With the worst of the London Stock Market Crash now over our focus has been turned once more to the tensions between ourselves and France, as well as the lingering possibility of open hostilities on the European mainland and overseas. The Admiralty has therefore approached the Government with plans to launch a large-scale naval exercise in the English Channel as a means of not only ensuring that the Royal Navy is up to the task of defending Britain, but also in an effort to send a message to the French that our resolve is as strong as ever."
ukf.71.d:0 "This morning the Director-General of the Deuxième Bureau met with our President to discussed the build-up of British Naval vessels inside the English Channel. While the Royal Navy regularly rotates its forces in and out of the Channel and overseas, our intelligence has reported that a far greater number of vessels has made port in Portsmouth and elsewhere along the English coast. The Deuxième Bureau believes that the British are preparing for a large scale naval exercise over the course of the next few weeks. With tensions still relatively high between our two nations the Marine Nationale has requested permission to order some French vessels to sea in the Channel as a means of observing the British naval exercises from afar to ensure they do not violate French territorial waters."
ukf.72.d:0 "Over two weeks have passed since the Channel Exercises began and we have learned much from the state of the Royal Navy. Some flaws were detected in our naval equipment, but by-and-large are sailors performed admirably and professionally. These exercises have provided us with some invaluable experience in regards to the preparation of the Royal Navy and its ability to defend our island home."
ukf.73.d:0 "Late yesterday evening fresh reports from Royal Navy Commanders participating in the Channel Exercises have indicated that several Royal Navy vessels are currently being shadowed by their counter-parts in the French Marine Nationale. Currently it is unknown why they have been watching our exercises so diligently. Theories range from poor attempts to spy on our navy to the more likely attempt to prevent our vessels from getting too close to French waters. Whatever the reason, it would seem that we have some unwanted observers for the rest of these exercises."
ukf.74.d:0 "At approximately 2:56am last night during live fire exercises, HMS Triton under command of Lieutenant Commander Steel, accidentally strayed into French territorial waters during our naval exercises. Upon entering French waters it would take an hour before HMS Triton would surface and identify that they had strayed out of the combat exercise area. Final communication between the Admiralty and Lieutenant Commander Steel indicated that they were attempting to return back to international waters when they were intercepted by a French vessel. Communications were abruptly cut short, and several Royal Navy vessels were dispatched to HMS Triton's last location. When reaching the destination, a squadron of French vessels were discovered and debris belonging to HMS Triton was found floating on the water close by.\n\nSo far the French Government has refused to comment on the actions taken against our vessel and a tense stand-off between Royal Navy and Marine Nationale ships has continued well into this morning. Circumstances surrounding the sinking of HMS Triton remain ambiguous at best."
ukf.75.d:0 "Last night one of our Destroyers - Le Fantasque - unexpectingly detected a submarine in our territorial waters. Believing it to be a vessel from the Royal Navy, and with suspicions high between our two nations, orders were dispatched to Le Fantasque to intercept the submarine and force it to surface so that it could be boarded.\n\nWhen within range of the submarine, Le Fantasque dropped several depth charges in an attempt to force the submarine to surface. The first two depth charges failed in their objective, but the third seemingly struck the submarine directly, causing a large explosion. French vessels were dispatched to the area to assist in rescuing survivors if any could be found, but the situation was only made worse by the arrival of several Royal Navy vessels to the area who immediately demanded our ships leave so that they could begin their own rescue operations.\n\nA tense diplomatic stand-off has continued between ourselves and Britain and has only been made worse by British demands for a full apology by our Government regarding the deaths of their sailors and loss of their vessel."
ukf.76.d:0 "The demands for a full apology from the French Government to the families of those now deceased sailors aboardf HMS Triton has been refused by the French Government. Claiming that the Royal Navy had unlawfully violated French sovereignty by entering into French territorial waters, the French Government has warned us of future provocations.\n\nOur Government is in a rage over this insult to our nation and those related to the deceased, and has come up with several plans to force the French to back down further. So far only a single plan has been approved by the Admiralty: it calls for the immediate deployment of the Mediterranean Fleet in a show of force to France that we will not back down over this issue."
ukf.77.d:0 "British diplomats in Paris today have reported back to Westminster regading meetings with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. Offering their sincere condolences for the loss of life suffered in the now regarded tragic accident, the French Government has agreed to formally write a letter to each of those relatives of the deceased in offer of apology."
ukf.78.d:0 "The British Government has this morning formally accepted our apology for the loss of life in the tragic incident between our two navies. Royal Navy vessels have once more returned to port and the Marine Nationale has removed most of its vessels from the Channel. Many are breathing the sigh of relief that this accident did not come to a further exchange of blows between the Royal Navy and Marine Nationale."
ukf.79.d:0 "Leaders of the Marine Nationale met with the President today along-side the Director-General of the Deuxième Bureau to discuss the new naval movements being made by the Royal Navy. Our refusal to issue an apology over the deaths of those on the British submarine has been met with silence from Westminster, but we have received reports that the British Mediterranean Fleet has left port and is heading for the coast of Algérie.\n\nMarine Nationale Admirals have therefore been instructed to deploy the necessary vessels to ward off the British threat to our nation and to send a clear message that France will not be intimidated by the presence of the Royal Navy."
ukf.80.t:0 "Battle of Mers-el-Kébir"
ukf.80.d:0 "At Eleven O'Clock this morning Royal Navy vessels approached French territorial waters once more, this time off the coast of Algérie, and were almost immediately met by their counter-parts in the Marine Nationale with a stand-off ensuing between the two fleets. Slightly over an hour later, a French submarine - Le Ariane -  came too close to the Royal Navy Battle Group and depth charges were dropped, causing significant damage to the vessel. Royal Navy ships in an attempt to pursue the submarine drifted inside French territorial waters, and several warning shots were exchanged between French and British vessels in the region. Le Ariane, still suffering damage from the incident exploded shortly after reaching the Marine Nationale fleet, and French commanders mis-took it for direct fire from the Royal Navy, with a battle soon developing between both sides.\n\nIt would take just a few hours before official orders from Westminster would be received by the Royal Navy Fleet to stand down all offensive operations, with the French Government sending similar orders to the Marine Nationale. Rescue operations are under-way by both sides, with some estimates of well over five hundred dead from both sides.\n\nBritish and French media have both claimed victory in this battle, though it remains to be seen if the conflict between France and Britain will escalate into war."
ukf.81.d:0 "With rescue operations now concluded both by the Royal Navy and Marine Nationale, reports have indicated that the French fleet has once more returned to port in the region. British media has claimed victory in this conflict between our nations, with some photographs of a French Battleship on fire and sinking being plastered all over local media. Unexpectingly French media has also claimed victory in the battle, claiming that the Marine Nationale destroyed more ships in the battle than she lost, less unexpectingly however it would seem that the French Government is unwilling to escalate this further between our nations. Perhaps the most significant flash-point between our two nations since the Fashoda Incident is now over, with many relieved that open war was avoided."

#Anglo-Portuguese Relations

ukf.90.d:0 "Portugal has been one of our closest allies for more than several centuries, and only recently renewed our close relations by signing the London Naval Treaty in 1931, they have in recent years become mired in political strife and civil war.\n\nWith our renewed interest in expanding our range of allies in Europe, reaffirming our alliance with Portugal seems like an obvious choice, and one that will almost certainly succeed."
ukf.91.d:0 "This morning the British representative in our capital approached our Government with an official proposal to join their alliance in an effort to strengthen the ties between our two nations and ensure mutual security in these troubled times. What should our reply be?"
ukf.92.d:0 "Much to the utter surprise of our Government the Portuguese Government has foolishly rejected our porposal for an alliance. They will surely come to regret this day."

#The Alaskan Territories
ukf.110.d:0 "The British Government has continued its string of renewed Imperialism in the Americas, this time by demanding the hand-over of our Alaskan territories to Canadian control. Washington, and the nation at large, is in an uproar over this blatant attempt at bullying our nation into submission. It seems we have little choice but to make the British learn the hard way that they should remain out of American affairs."
ukf.111.d:0 "The American Government has once again shown its complete ignorance of the military situation surrounding its nation, this time by refusing our quite reasonable demand to hand over their Alaskan territories to the Dominion of Canada. Our Government and people are of one mind; the Americans must be punished for refusing our demands!"
ukf.112.d:0 "Quite unsurprisingly, the American Government has folded to our demands for the hand-over of their Alaskan territory to the Dominion of Canada. For a while it seemed that Washington was prepared to make a fight of the matter, but sensible minds prevailed and brought reason to the US Government. Alaska is ours, and with it, our dominance in North America is assured."

#Anglo-Japanese Ties
ukf.120.d:0 "The Empire of Japan, since its restoration in 1868, has quickly become a new global power to be reckoned with. Their surprise defeat of the Russian Empire at the beginning of this century shocked many nations, but where others found disbelief, we saw a potential new ally. During the Great War, the Japanese Empire assisted our nation in defeating the Germans in Asia, and since that time we have maintained a close relation with their nation.\n\nThe time has therefore come for us to consider reinvigorating ties between our two nations by formally inviting them to our alliance."
ukf.121.d:0 "The British Empire has today extended a generous offer to our Government. They propose that we formalise an alliance between our two nations by joining the IPA. By doing so we will surely bring peace and stability to Asia."
ukf.123.d:0 "The Japanese representative in London today has signed the new treaty between our two nations, officially making them a part of the Imperial Protection Alliance."

#The Mountain Passes
ukf.130.d:0 "Nepal and Bhutan have long been under our sphere of influence, since the days of the East India Company right up until the modern day. However, in this time of great political change it is looking increasingly likely that the two mountain nations will drift from our influence and fall to the new powers of China and Japan.\n\nWe cannot allow this to happen, their location is vital for securing the Raj against foreign invasion or influence across China. It also provides a perfect defensive frontier against the Chinese should they choose to set their sights on our Indian holdings. Therefore we must decide on the best course of action regarding the mountain pass, do we take control of it directly or entrench our influence so that it cannot be contested?"
ukf.131.d:0 "We have been delivered an ultimatum by the British: become an official protectorate of their Empire or face them on the field of battle. Their power is overwhelming and they outnumber us on an absurd scale, but if we take advantage of our terrain we may just be able to hold them off for long enough so as to keep our sovereignty."
ukf.132.d:0 "The Nepalese have accepted our ultimatum and have officially become a protectorate, rejoice for our influence has expanded!"
ukf.133.d:0 "The Bhutanese have accepted our ultimatum and have officially become a protectorate, rejoice for our influence has expanded!"
ukf.134.d:0 "The Nepalese have refused our ultimatum to become our protectorate! It seems they will only be persuaded through force."
ukf.135.d:0 "The Bhutanese have refused our ultimatum to become our protectorate! It seems they will only be persuaded through force."
ukf.136.d:0 "Britain has demanded that we become an official part of the Raj. We cannot hope to beat them in a war, but with good use of our terrain we can hope to inflict enough damage so as to make them give in and accept our sovereignty."
ukf.137.d:0 "The Nepalese have accepted our ultimatum and have officially become part of the Raj, rejoice for our influence has expanded!"
ukf.138.d:0 "The Bhutanese have accepted our ultimatum and have officially become part of the Raj, rejoice for our influence has expanded!"
ukf.139.d:0 "The Nepalese have refused our ultimatum to become part of the Raj! It seems they will only be persuaded through force."
ukf.140.d:0 "The Bhutanese have refused our ultimatum to become part of the Raj! It seems they will only be persuaded through force."

#Cape to Cairo
ukf.150.d:0 "Cecil Rhodes, an ambitious British businessman and prominent Imperialist and a man who pushed the boundaries of colonisation by establishing the British South Africa Company in 1888. This company would go on to establish the colonies of Rhodesia and administer the lands of the Bechuanaland even to this day. A great man, whose triumphant will and national pride led him deep into the heart of Africa with the goal of expanding British control to the areas he explored. It is thanks to him that we stand as the largest Empire the world has ever seen.\n\nOne of his greatest ambitions was the idea of a Cape to Cairo Railroad, and while such an idea never came to fruition in his lifetime, it has recently been realised. As the first trains set off from the Cape on their great journey up the Dark Continent, the greatness of Cecil Rhodes has been remembered by all at his reburial ceremony in London. He has been reburied with full honours, with many great guests in attendance including the King himself who personally gave a speech about the importance of Rhodes’ work to the British.\n\n''If Rhodes were alive today, he would be overcome with joy at the extent of the modern British Empire – and if it weren’t for him, then we may never have reached such grandeur.''"

#Mesopotamia
ukf.160.d:0 "The Mesopotamia region is the next stepping stone in the Cape to Singapore project, their lands are vital for connecting Kuwait through to Calcutta to the line. They also harbour great reserves of oil, and thanks to the recent instability in the region we can take advantage of the turmoil and demand that they submit to our rule. The Iraqi nation is a new creation, and so it is doubtable if anyone will miss them should they disappear."
ukf.161.d:0 "We have been delivered demands by the British, demanding that we become a protectorate under their control. Owing to the recent instability in our nation, it might be wise for us to accept and bring in a more stable – if British – Government."
ukf.162.d:0 "Iraq has agreed to become our protectorate, we can now push forward into Persia."
ukf.163.d:0 "Iraq has refused our offer to become a protectorate, the instability in the region will continue and as it does it shall block our ambitions and our path into Persia. Therefore, we must secure the region no matter the cost!"

#Securing Persian Oil
ukf.165.d:0 "Persia is an important gateway between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. It also contains some of the richest oil fields in the world, oil fields that should be under the control of the Anglo-Persian. However, due to the recent political machinations within Persia our control has been greatly contested. We must therefore step in and take control of the situation ourselves, as the Iranians have clearly failed to do so. The question is though, how far do we take it?"
ukf.166.d:0 "Britain has demanded that we become a protectorate, such a ridiculous request must of course be rejected. British influence in our nation must be crushed, and to do that we are willing to go to war!"
ukf.167.d:0 "Persia has agreed to our demands and has become a protectorate under our control. The oil is secured, as is the passage between the Middle East and India. We can now continue with our great Railway plans."
ukf.168.d:0 "Persia has rejected our gracious offer to become a protectorate. We will not allow them to go on unpunished, we must deliver justice and pave the way forward for our Railway! Nothing can stop us!"
ukf.169.d:0 "Today the British representative in Tehran has issued a stern word of warning to our Government: they have threatened our nation with war if we do not cede our southern coast to their control immediately. The Royal Navy has already been spotted near the Strait of Hormuz and a build-up of troops has been detected nearby, it seems they are genuine about their threats of war."
ukf.170.d:0 "With the threat of war weighing heavily upon their shoulders, the Persian Government has seen reason and ceded their southern coastline to our nation."
ukf.171.d:0 "It seems there is only one master of the Persian Government; insanity, as today Persian officials in London have rebuked our demand to cede their southern coast to our nation. It seems that only war is only option left to win these territories."

#Finish the Great Game
ukf.180.d:0 "Since the early 19thC, relations between ourselves and the Russians in Central Asia have been bordering on the hostile. Both of our nations attempted to exert our own influence on the region, in what has become known as the Great Game. The Russians sought to conquer more land for their Empire, while we were only interested in defending our India territory. Today, only one nation remains independent between our two nations; Afghanistan. While useful as a buffer between ourselves and the God-less Communists that today now control the former Russian Empire, the time has come to bring Afghanistan directly under our control in order to construct a strong defence against the Soviet threat from the North. It is doubtful that the Afghanistani government will accept our generous offer, so we must be prepared for war with their nation."
ukf.181.d:0 "The British representative in Kabul today has demanded that our nation become a protectorate of the British Empire due to the threat posed by the Soveit Union to our North. While the threat posed by the Communists is real, by becoming a protectorate of the Empire we will merely be their puppet. Is our independence worth sacrificing for a semblance of security?"
ukf.182.d:0 "Taking us quite by surprise, the government in Afghanistan has agreed to our proposal to become a protectorate of the Empire. It seems that their fear of the Soviets is more potent than we first believed."
ukf.183.d:0 "It seems that our preparations for war with Afghanistan were prudent, as today the Afghan government rejected our proposal for their nation to become a protectorate of the British Empire. It seems we will not only have to protect them from the Soviets, but also from themselves."
ukf.185.d:0 "The Trancaspian Government's existence in Central Asia only began in the latter years of the Russian Civil War, and has since remained relatively unscathed despite internal political turmoil. Influence from our Government in the region is exceptionally strong, with the Transcaspian nation heavily reliant upon us economically. With the Collectivists to the North, securing Transcaspia would present us with the perfect opportunity to strike the Russians where they are weakest, if it becomes a necessity."

#Portuguese Civil War
ukf.195.d:0 "Portuguese Monarchists forces successfully ejected their Republican opponents from the Portuguese mainland almost a year ago, forcing the Republicans into exile in Portuguese Africa. Though a stalemate developed between the two as neither side had the capacity to launch an invasion of the other's territory, that was until recently.\n\nWith the Portuguese Monarchists having consolidated power in the mainland, they have renewed the campaign against their Republican enemies by promising to liberate all Portuguese territory. With our position not only as a long-standing ally of Portugal, but also our geographical position between Portuguese Angola and Mozambique, we have several options available to us in assisting our friends in their campaign against their enemies."

#Monroe Disputes

ukf.210.d:0 "Grave news from London has indicated that the British Government is in the process of making a new policy statement regarding their foreign objectives in the Americas. Confirmed by the British Ambassador in Washington just this morning, we have learned that London intends to rebuke the Monroe Doctrine and inform our Government that it 'shall pursue diplomatic objectives with any country in the Americas, regardless of American feeling towards imperialism in North & South America'. Such a direct threat to our interests will only undermine what influence we have with the South American nations. In order to ensure our continued diplomatic clout in the Americas we must issue a stern response to the British."
ukf.211.d:0 "This morning the American Ambassador in London issued a note to our Government, stating that our planned extension of diplomatic influence in the Americas is unacceptable. Arguing that our Government have nefarious interests and plan to once more bring Imperialism to the Americas, they have stated that this new policy would not go unanswered. While we did expect a response from the Americans in this matter, it is notable that this is nothing but a basic warning rather than threat of armed conflict over our policies. It is possible the Americans are trying to save face with this maneuver."
ukf.212.d:0 "Late yesterday evening our Ambassador in Washington was summoned by the Secretary of State of the United States to attend a closed-doors meeting regarding our recent foreign policy adjustments in regards to the Monroe Doctrine and the Americas as a whole. In no uncertain terms the Secretary of State made it clear that if our nation were to pursue these policies that it would jeopardise the peace between us, and potentially lead to armed conflict between our two nations.\n\nOur Ambassador to the United States has reported that he believes these threats to be genuine and that by rebuking the Monroe Doctrine that we have crossed a clear line for the American Government. Many within our Government are however in clear disagreement, believing that the Americans are once more making much fuss of nothing and that they would not risk a war that they would surely lose over a silly bit of paper."
ukf.213.d:0 "Despite our warning having been delivered to Westminster by our Ambassador in London we have yet to receive any response from the British Government over the matter. It would seem that the British Government has decided to ignore our interests in the Americas and openly flaunt our power in the region. Our responses are limited, and if we hope to continue dissuading European powers from meddling in the Americas we have little choice but to back our warnings with action."
ukf.214.d:0 "It would seem that sanity has left the halls of Westminster, as today our representative in London was summoned by the Foreign Minister of the British Government into a private meeting. Stating unequivocally that the British Empire would not be threatened by 'nothing more than a former colonial' she would take any threats of force as an insult to the dignity of the British nation and its people, and would therefore reciprocate accordingly.\n\nThese veiled threats by the British Government clearly indicate that they do not take our warnings seriously. If we are to save face in this crisis it may be necessary to follow through on these warnings, although the willingness of the British to threaten our nation with war indicates a level of preparedness on their part to engage in a direct conflict with our nation."

#Removing the Final Roadblock

ukf.350.d:0 "With the Cape to Calcutta railway now well under construction and the direct link between our African and Indian colonies secure, only one final roadblock remains in our way; the Kingdom of Siam.\n\nFriendly to our nation in the Great War, recently Siam has been mired by protests from revolutionary elements opposed to the King's rule in their nation. Such instability has weakened the King's grip significantly, and those within our Government believe the time has come to demand the Kra-Isthmus from Siam, thereby ensuring a direct link between Burma and Malaya, as well as allowing us to further extend the Cape to Calcutta rail line as far as Singapore."
ukf.351.d:0 "This morning the British representative in our capital delivered a letter to our Government demanding that we become a protectorate of the British Empire 'in the interests of regional security'. Such a demand is clearly outrageous, though one can only wonder what the British will do if we refuse."
ukf.354.d:0 "Late yesterday evening the British representative in Bangkok delivered a letter to our Government demanding the immediate transfer of the Kra-Isthmus to British control. Stating that the region had in recent years become a territory where rebels had been coordinating attacks against British Administration in Malaya, they have argued that our Government has done nothing to prevent these attacks. Such lies are preposterous nonsense, but the British would not issue this demand if they were not serious."

#2GW Intervention

ukf.4999.d:0 "With war having once more broken our across the European mainland between Germany and France our Government has grown increasingly worried about what the results of the war may mean for the European status quo. Growingly there are suggestions that in order to claim a stake in the post-war peace process that Britain herself must become involved in the Second Great War, although the question remains: Which side should we support in this new war?"
ukf.5000.d:0 "Now that we have decided to support the French Government in the war in Europe, we must decide to which level they should receive support. Those within our Government who still harbour some isolationist tendencies have argued that we should limit our support for France, and send them purely shipments of weapons to aid in their fight. While those more concerned about what a Europe dominated by Germany may look like have argued that the time has arrived for us to consider wholesale intervention against the German nation by a direct declaration of war."
ukf.5002.d:0 "Just over one month ago we sent a large shipment of supplies to the French nation to assist in their war against Germany, and while the assistance was appreciated by the French nation it has, so far, been unsuccessful in turning the tide of the war. Many within our Government believe that now is the time for our nation to involve ourselves directly in the war against Germany."

ukf.6000.d:0 "Now that we have chosen to support the German Government against the French in the current war in Europe, the time has arrived for us to decide what type of support we shall provide for them. Many within our Government who are fearful of intervening directly have suggested that we should send a large shipment of arms and supplies to the Germans to assist in the fighting, though those more hawkish members of Parliament believe that only by directly involving ourselves in this conflict may be finally deal with the French threat once and for all."
ukf.6002.d:0 "It has been over a month since we sent arms and supplies to Germany and while they were graciosuly received, they have made little impact on the fighting itself. It seems that if we are to ensure France's defeat is this conflict, we may need to involve ourselves directly in this war."

#Reform Entente
ukf.5013.d:0 "With both ourselves and the British Empire at war with the German menace for the second time in less than forty years, politicians on both sides of the English Channel have been communciating regularly both to coordinate our military operations against our shared enemy, but also in an attempt to revive the Entente Cordiale, which ended several years ago.\n\nToday these efforts have borne fruit, as Westminster has officially proposed the renewal of the Entente and th emerger of both of our alliances to form a united front against the Germans."
ukf.5014.d:0 "As the war continues against the Germans, cooperation between ourselves and the French continues daily. To facilitate the creation of a united front against the gravest threat Europe has faced since the Great War, the French Government has agreed to our proposal that we officially re-establish the Entente Cordiale between our two nations.\n\nA new dawn has broken over Europe, one in which marks the beginning of the end of the German menace."

#League of Nations
ukf.6010.d:0 "As our glorious war against the Soviets continues, we have found an unlikely ally in the British Empire. While allied to the Russian Empire during the Great War, the British government has since the events of the Russian Revolution maintained relatively hostile relations with the Collectivist threat, obviously seeing them as a large threat to not only European stability, but also their influence in Central Asia.\n\nDiplomatic cooperation between our nations have been limited due to the poor relations between our two nations in the early years of this decade, though as the war progresses the British have come to see that by acting together, we may strike a greater blow against our mutual enemies. As such British diplomats in Berlin have this morning officially proposed the creation of an alliance between our two nations to counter the growing threat from the Soviet menace. While some in our Government believe such an alliance to be wholly unnecessary, and lay blame on Britain for our catastrophic loss in the Great War, some have begun to see the possibilities that an alliance with the British may afford our nation."

oukf.1.d:0 "The oldest alliance on Earth exists between our fair nation and Portugal, dating as far back as the 14th century our two nations have been closely bonded ever since. The time has come to once again decide how we should conduct ourselves with the Portuguese; the topic of Anglo-Portuguese relations has been open to question for some time due to the nature of Portugal’s Government.\n\nAt present we have four residing options for Portugal: Renew the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, pressure the Government to reform into a more democratic system. Alternatively we could demand control over some of their African possessions, or we could betray 600 years of friendship, and prepare for war with the Portuguese to further our own interests."
oukf.2.d:0 "Our oldest ally, Britain, has one again approached us with an offer to renew the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, dating back to 1386. Their influence within our country is tremendous, and they have been a great help to our nation in times of trouble. It is expected that we take them up on this offer."
oukf.3.d:0 "Britain, our oldest and most trusted friend has betrayed us! They have issued us a series of demands that we relinquish control over much of our African territory and hand it over to them, just as we had to in 1890 with what is now Rhodesia. Accepting their demands would be humiliating, but we may not have a choice in the matter."
oukf.4.d:0 "The Portuguese have replied to our demands, and have refused them and have begun attempting to remove our influence from their country. Their insolence must be punished, for we shall not be humiliated like this!"
oukf.5.d:0 "The Portuguese reply to our offer to renew the alliance has been met with shock. They have refused our offer and have turned their backs on 600 years of friendship; however, we must respect their decision. It is their loss, not ours."
oukf.6.d:0 "We have recently made a curious discovery, that the British embassy and other prominent Englishmen within our country have begun attempting to spread ideas of democracy and fomenting unrest amongst our populace. Why the British would do such a thing is unknown, causing instability and meddling with the affairs of a sovereign nation is sure to put a strain on the international view of the British and their aggression."
oukf.7.d:0 "Our campaign to bring democracy to Portugal has been progressing well in the past 6 months. It has now reached a point where we have fostered significant levels of influence within the nation, giving us the option to speed this process up. Some of the more aggressive members of our cabinet are suggesting we begin staging a democratic coup within Portugal, risking our friendship in order to spread the light of democracy. Others argue though that doing such a thing is unprovoked and will surely fail, resulting in nothing but unnecessary strains on our relations."
oukf.8.d:0 "It has been several years since our Government established itself as undisputed rulers of Portugal and since that time we have had very little in the way of open resistance to our rule. Since the British Government began influencing our politics however there has been a marked increase in criticism of our rule, and today it appears to have manifested as open protests on the streets of Lisbon.\n\nWhen the protests began their numebrs were small, but since that time they have swelled exponentially. Those involved are rather belligerent and openly hostile to our Government, even now they threaten our rule over Portugal. In the coming days the politics of our nation may be changed dramatically."
oukf.9.d:0 "Our democratic coup in Portugal has been a smashing success, their authoritarian regime has been toppled and the will of the people shall be heard! With our victory Portugal is closer to our own nation diplomatically than ever before."
oukf.10.d:0 "Our attempted coup in Portugal has been met with failure. The crowds of pro-democratic protestors could not withstand the power of the Portuguese police, who brutally put down the protest with force. Such a flagrant display of authoritarian brutality will surely keep the light of democracy alive within the Portuguese populace; however, we can no longer support them."
oukf.11.d:0 "The attempted democratic coup within our government has recently discovered to have been funded by British wealth and influence. These traitorous ‘friends’ of ours have overstepped their boundaries; it is time we freed ourselves from their influence once and for all!"
oukf.12.d:0 "Following the failure of our coup to bring freedom to Portugal, it would seem that our role in the whole thing has been discovered. The Portuguese are accusing us of backstabbing them, and thoroughly damaging our international reputation."
oukf.13.d:0 "Gibraltar is one of the most important possessions we hold, it opens the way for trade into the Mediterranean Sea and provides us with an excellent basing point for strikes into the region. It is therefore imperative that we protect it by any means necessary and so extensive plans for increasing fortifications in the territory have been put forward that will enable us to defend Gibraltar from both land and sea."
oukfa.31.d:0 "Denmark controls the only two points of naval access into the Baltic Sea: the Danish Straits and the Kiel Canal. Access into the region is vital to our trade, and so we must secure influence over Denmark in order to protect access from the growing German and Soviet threats.\n\nWe have two options when dealing with the Danes, we can either ask them to join our International Protection Alliance thereby securing them from any outside threat, or alternatively we could demand they sign onto the London Naval Treaty meaning our influence in the nation would be almost absolute.\n\nHow should we proceed?"
oukfb.31.d:0 "Denmark controls the one of only two naval access passages into the Baltic Sea: the Danish Straits. Access into the region is vital to our trade, and so we must secure influence over Denmark in order to protect access from the growing German and Soviet threats.\n\nWe have two options when dealing with the Danes, we can either ask them to join our International Protection Alliance thereby securing them from any outside threat, or alternatively we could demand they sign onto the London Naval Treaty meaning our influence in the nation would be almost absolute.\n\nHow should we proceed?"
oukf.32.d:0 "A British emissary arrived today with a request of our Government. They ask that we sign onto the London Naval Treaty, a treaty created by the British in 1924 to cement their influence in many nations across the globe. What this treaty entails is assurance from the United Kingdom that they shall protect us from any external threat, in exchange that we bend to their whim and severely limit the extent of our own navy allowing the British to exercise any level of control and influence in our nation.\n\nWith the growing threat posed by the Valkists to the south and the Communists to the East, signing this treaty may be our only way to survive the coming storm."
oukf.33.d:0 "Our gracious offer to the Danish to join the London Naval Treaty has been met with rejection! Many in our government are urging for us to take action against such insolence – especially with how vital Denmark is for securing the North Sea. In fact, the Royal Navy has informed us that plans are in place for a full blockade of the Danish, and subsequently the Baltic Sea. While such a move is daring, and would certainly provoke a serious international backlash and possible escalation, our navy is still unmatched and so any attempt to break the blockade with force could be easily stopped.\n\nA fierce debate has been raging in the Commons the past week as to what to do regarding this situation, and it is today that the final decision must be made."
oukf.34.d:0 "Unbelievably, the British have actually responded to our refusal of their ridiculous offer. In an absurd waste of time and resources, they have sent the Royal Navy – the largest Navy in the world – to blockade us?! It is not even just our nation that they are blockading; it is the entirety of the Baltic Sea! They have now issued us an ultimatum, surrender to the British demands and join their Naval Treaty or face the blockade. Such an absurd abuse of their power has already attracted international attention, as the French have assured us that they will do everything in their power to protect us if need be."
oukf.35.d:0 "The Danes have folded to our might! Our blockade was a smashing success, and the Danish have agreed to sign the London Naval Treaty putting them just where we want them, under our absolute influence. Access to the Baltic is secure, no more shall Valkism or Communism threaten the North Sea!"
oukf.36.d:0 "The British blockade of the Baltic Sea has gone too far, and the Danes have turned to us for support. We cannot allow such rampant Imperialism and power projection to go unabashed on the European continent; we shall of course be supporting the Danes and have developed a plan of attack to break up the blockade. Obviously, we cannot rely on our navy to break the blockade no matter how strong it is; therefore we shall use our air force to rain death from above using Danish airfields as a forward vantage point. \n\nThe attack shall commence as follows: Phase one is a mass assault of fighter aircraft to secure the air for the rest of the operation. Phase two will consist of waves of naval dive bombers, striking and hopefully rupturing the smaller ships of the Royal Navy in order to thin their numbers. The final phase, phase three, will be made up of waves of torpedo bomber aircraft to target and cripple the capital ships of the Royal Navy. This plan is certainly ambitious, and may not succeed, but it is our hope that this attack will scare the Royal Navy away and contain them into their own petty sphere of influence!\n\nIt is vital that this plan be carried out in the utmost secrecy, because if we are exposed as the ones behind this strike then the British will surely escalate this conflict further."
oukfa.37.d:0 "Our Air force has reported today that the elaborate Aalborg raid to splinter the Royal Navy blockade has failed. Many of our aircraft were shot down and many good men died while doing almost nothing to the British forces, and so the blockade continues.\n\nWe shall provide aid to Denmark if need be, and we have already lodged a diplomatic protest against the British in the hopes that others would follow. However, this raid was a stretch too far in the time we had to prepare. All we can hope for is that the Danes will not surrender to such Gunboat Diplomacy!"
oukfb.37.d:0 "Our Air force has reported today that our brilliant raid at Aalborg went just as planned! The Royal Navy have been splintered and have rushed back to the safety of English waters, while many aircraft and men were lost on our side, the Royal Navy lost much more with many of their ships damaged and some sunk.\n\nIt would seem that the time of the Dreadnought is over, and that aircraft will sink the doctrine of the Grand Fleet once and for all. Through aircraft, we will rupture the Pax Britannica!"
oukfb.38.d:0 "Reports from the Royal Navy have indicated today that they came under heavy air attack whilst off the Danish coast at Aalborg. Some ships were badly damaged – with some of them even being sunk or scuttled - and many of our good men have been severely injured or killed in the attack. The damaged ships were ordered to go back to Scapa Flow for repairs, when on their way they spotted the floating wreckage of a downed aircraft from the attack. The pilot was still alive, floating desperately before being captured. He was French, as was his aircraft. Therefore we have one conclusion as to who is behind this attack, once again we find ourselves at odds with our old rivals."
oukfa.38.d:0 "The Royal Navy has reportedly come under heavy aerial assault off the coast at Aalborg today, none of our ships were too badly damaged or sunk but some have been ordered back to Scapa Flow for repairs and checks. Despite the vast nature of the attack, the combatant responsible has yet to be identified. Denmark does not have an air force large enough for such an operation, so it seems likely that a foreign power was behind this assault. Given our frayed relations with continental Europe, it could be any one, or many, of them.\n\nDuring the attack we managed to destroy many of the enemy aircraft, and so have sent out smaller flotillas to find any aircraft or pilots that survived in order to identify the guilty party. Whoever is behind this attack is a truly cowardly nation, with neither guts nor the strength to contest our hegemony openly."
oukf.39.d:0 "Upon returning to Scapa Flow for repairs, one of our ships spotted a downed aircraft from the raid earlier this week. A scouting party was dispatched from the ship to find any signs of a survivor, unfortunately no one was found. However, something more interesting was discovered, that nature of the aircraft. It is a French torpedo bomber aircraft and is identical to those that swarmed the blockading ships, meaning that only one nation can be behind the attack.\n\nWe must now decide how to respond, seeing as we have caught the French red handed. The Royal Navy are awaiting our orders, and some in the High Command are suggesting we attack or harass a French fleet out of port. Many of those within the Government are however, suggesting we simply embargo the French as they rely heavily on our imports and can be starved into submission. The opposition in the Commons, as well as the Doves within our own cabinet, are still calling for us to call of the blockade – but we have gone too far to back down now."
oukf.40.d:0 "Despite our the Aalborg Raid being a resounding success against les Rosbifs, the British Government has in recent days made a large spectacle over what they have told the international community is undeniable proof that the French nation was behind the attack, their 'proof' is plane wreckage from several of our aircraft, aircraft that is only designed and manufactured in France and only flown by French pilots.\n\nWhile we have been waiting some time to figure out what the British would do in retaliation, this morning they announced their intentions. The British Empire is imposing a total embargo on our nation."
oukf.41.d:0 "At 5:34 this morning, the French fleet off the coast of Mers El Kébir was attacked by an unknown force composed of numerous vessels, the naval engagement took place over several hours, leaving many ships destroyed and even more dead.\n\nAs our patrols scoured the area after the battle searching for clues as to the nature of the attackers, we discovered a recently scuttled Destroyer-class vessel. The vessel in question was identified as HMS Bulldog by the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Operations shortly after, a Destroyer formerly belonging to the Royal Navy.\n\nIt is clear that this attack is in retaliation for our raid near Aalborg in the past weeks. Our Government is in a difficult position, several of our ships in the Mediterranean Fleet have been sunk, hundreds of French sailors are dead, our nation calls for action against the British for this heinous crime. There may only be one option we have left to take."
oukf.42.d:0 "Intelligence reports from the coasts of Denmark have made known this morning that the Royal Navy retreated back to port in mainland Britain following their short-lived, and ultimately unsuccessful blockade. It is clear that the blockade was ended following the success of the Aalborg Raid, and while many within our Govenrment had predicted some sort of retaliation by the British Government either militarily, economically or diplomatically, the British Government apparently doesn't have the stomach for a major confrontation between itself and European powers at this time.\n\nIt is clear that our victory today has shown to the British that gunboat diplomacy is not always successful."
oukf.43.d:0 "The blasted French have backed down from supporting us in the face of the British. We are now lacking any real international support and face the full might, not just of Britain and the Royal Navy, but of the whole British Empire. This blockade will be brutal on us and the rest of the Baltic, but eventually the British will have to back down, they cannot keep this up in the face of such overwhelming international backlash. Although, maybe being under their protection wouldn’t be so bad after all."
oukf.44.d:0 "The British Embassy in Copenhagen has delivered an offer to us today; they are offering us a place in the Imperial Protection Alliance. Joining this alliance will officially place us under their protection from foreign powers but will anger the Germans and French greatly, as it gives the British even greater influence over the sea. They have assured us that their interests are in the preservation of Denmark and democracy; however, it is up to us to decide whether or not to join."
oukf.45.d:0 "Our embassy in Copenhagen has informed us today that the Danish government had rejected our offer of an alliance. While this will mean we cannot extend our influence over the Baltic Sea, and that Denmark is still under threat from extremist powers, we must respect the sovereign will of another nation. After all, it is our duty to uphold justice and democracy."
oukf.46.d:0 "As the the Royal Navy retreated from the waters near Aalborg a Royal Navy Destroyer-class vessel, HMS Amazon, discovered the wreckage of numerous French aircraft as well as a single surviving French pilot. Despite the iron-clad proof that the France was behind this dastardly attack the French Government has refused to acknowledge allegations of their involvement in attacking the Royal Navy, instead pointing to previous examples of British Imperialism and how the European mainland would not let Britain use her Navy to intimidate other nations.\n\nWith French involvement all but guaranteed, it is up to Westminster to decide what course of action we should take in response. A fierce debate rages in Parliament as to what the nature of our retaliation should be. One thing is for certain however, we have come too far to turn back without suffering a serious loss of stability at home and a loss of face abroad."
oukf.47.d:0 "During the Great War the North Atlantic was a key battleground in the German submarine campaign against our nation. The German Government made quite the impact in their attempt to strangle our nation into submission, and while the Admiralty was slow to learn that convoy usage was essential in preventing losses, it is not a fact lost on them today, nor is the potency of submarine warfare.\n\nAs such the Admiralty has been working diligently towards presenting severals plans to our Government that will hopefully assist us greatly in rooting out submarines in the North Atlantic in any future war we may be involved in. These plans focus around utilising the Danish North Atlantic possessions to base our own vessels out of, and also prevent others from doing so as well. We have many choices in how to fulfil this objective, but ultimately the choice rests with the Government."
oukfa.48.d:0 "With the British only recently making demands of our nation it could be believed that they would refrain from doing so in the near future, this belief however, was shattered this morning. The British representative in Copenhagen presented our Government with a demand of the complete hand-over of our North Atlantic Possessions to the British Empire as a means of 'securing the safety of trade in the region and stability of the North Atlantic'. Our Government is quite out-raged at this demand, with our politicians oddly in agreement over this threat to Danish sovereignty."
oukfb.48.d:0 "With the British only recently making demands of our nation it could be believed that they would refrain from doing so in the near future, this belief however, was shattered this morning. The British representative in Copenhagen presented our Government with their demand to immediately grant a referendum in Iceland to determine the future of the island as either independent or as a part of our nation.\n\nThe Icelandic national movement has in recent years been gaining ground and it is widely believed that any referendum on independence would end poorly for us. It is also worth noting that our Intelligence Services have determined that the British Government is influencing the main Icelandic leaders calling for independence, and that in the event of a referendum victory Iceland would fall directly under British influence and protection."
oukfc.48.d:0 "In recent days the British representative in Copenhagen has made overtures towards our Government over an agreement which would allow Royal Navy vessels to station and re-fuel themselves in our ports in the North Atlantic, as well as allow the British Army to station soldiers to defend these vulnerable territories. The reasoning behind this proposal, the British say, is due to their worry that these islands may fall under the occupation of foreign powers hostile to their interests. Many within our Government are quite surprised at this suggestion, as allowing the British to station soldiers and vessels in these territories is the equivalent of an occupation in many ways."
oukf.49.d:0 "Our recent proposal sent to the Danish was met with acceptance on their part. It seems they believe that denying us this request would only have made matters worse for themselves."
oukf.50.d:0 "With the Royal Navy blockade of our nation continuing seemingly unabated our people have begun to suffer greatly under the strain. Our economy has in many ways been shattered by the blockade and if it is not lifted we may soon see civil unrest on our streets.\n\nThe British Government is very aware of this predicament and has proposed a deal to relieve the blockade in return for us handing over our North Atlantic territories to them. Given the effect the blockade is having on our nation, our politicians are seemingly quite happy to abandon these frozen wastelands in return for a return to normalcy."
oukfa.51.d:0 "The Danish Government has quite wisely responded positively to our offer to lift the blockade of their nation in return for their North Atlantic territories."
oukfb.51.d:0 "It seems apparent that madness has gripped the Danish Government completely, as they have utterly refused to hand over their North Atlantic territories in return for the lifting of the blockade against their nation. Their stubborness will certainly be their downfall."
oukf.52.d:0 "Despite our demands being quite reasonable as a means of ensuring stability and security in the North Atlantic, the Danish Government has felt it necessary to decline our demands completely."


ukf.140.d:0 "Ever since the 20thC began we have been at loggerheads with the Germans over their naval policy and their quest to pursue an overseas Empire in direct competition with our own. When the German Empire was dismembered in the wake of the Great War their colonial aspirations ceased to exist, and their navy was sailed to Scapa Flow where it was scuttled by the Germans in an act of defiance.\n\nSince that time Germany has slowly been re-building both its industry and its navy, unimpeded by any impositions from our Government regarding their navy's size and composition. As Europe, and the world at large grows closer to war our Government has decided that the time has come to settle the issue of our competitiveness with the Germans once and for all.\n\nChiefly the Admiralty has proposed that we demand that the Germans sign an agreement with our nation which will limit their ship-building severely, thereby ending any possibility of a future naval race with our nation. This agreement is unlikely to be signed by the Germans unless they are persuaded into believing that should the agreement not be ratified that we may be required to pressure this pact upon them through force of arms. Whatever our choice, our nation and Empire must prepare for another war with Germany, and this war may be more bloody than the last."
ukf.141.d:0 "In recent months the British delegation in Berlin has been making overtures towards our Government in an attempt to smooth over relations between our two respective nations. Fearful of another naval race such as the one that took place before the Weltkrieg, the British have requested that we sign a naval treaty with their nation which will significantly reduce our ship-building capacity and limit our ability to produce new vessels quickly. This agreement seems ludicrous at first glance but the British have inferred that if we do not sign the agreement then they may be forced to take matters into their own hands to prevent our nation from competing with them on the seas and oceans.\n\nFear can drive men to insanity, and it seems it has the same effect on nations. If we intend to refuse the British demands we must prepare ourselves for a possible war."
ukf.142.d:0 "The German delegation in London today handed our Government a formal reply to our proposed naval treaty with Berlin. In the reply they stated unequivocally that they would not hinder the development of the Kriegsmarine to 'satisfy the delusions of the British Empire' and that our nation had no right to make threats of force against other sovereign great powers in Europe, and the world."
ukf.143.d:0 "Our representative in Berlin today concluded fresh meetings with the German Foreign Minister over the proposed London-Berlin Naval Treaty that was recently put forward by our government as a means of securing peace between our two great nations. The German Foreign Minister stated that while it was the wish of the German nation to pursue a sophisticated navy with several modern vessels, that it was in the opinion of the German Government that it should not be pursued if it meant that war between the UK and Germany would become more likely.\n\nThis is a monumentous day for Anglo-German relations; the proverbial hatchet has been buried between us and a new dawn on both Germany and the British Empire has begun."
ukf.150.d:0 "With the signing of the Entente Cordiale on the 8th April 1908, the French Republic and the British Empire cast aside centuries of rivalry in order to prepare themselves for combatting the larger threat of German military and economic dominance of the continent. The struggles of the Great War forged a bond beteen our two nations, but old habits die hard.\n\nIn the ensuing years of peace the British Empire and the French Republic once again clashed for influence overseas in Colonial Africa and Asia. Now without a common enemy to bind them together it seemed that every small difference was magnified significantly. The economic boom of the 1920's was felt globally, especially so in the Empire. France, hoping to share in the prosperity, found itself shut out by the British with high tariffs placed upon their nation as a means of ensuring British economic dominance. As the French chafed over trade restrictions the British were equally angered by French attempts to dominate the continent and position itself as the sole leader of Europe. Suspicious of their motives, Britain increased the size of the Royal Navy and attempted to halt French expansions overseas.\n\nAs the 1930's drag on, the years of bickering between France and Britain seem almost a life-time away. Europe is near crisis once again, but our gaze cannot help but be drawn to renewed French attempts at construction of a large navy in cooperation with their Italian allies. If there is to be hope for reconciliation with France then we must ensure our place as master of the seas without fear of French competition, otherwise we will be left with only one option."
ukf.151.d:0 "After several years of cold exchanges between ourselves and the United Kingdomon, the British delegation in Paris has in recent weeks attempted to mend faces rapidly between our two nations. Fearful of another large conflict in Europe, the British have made it known that they are willing to back us on several important matters, but at a large price. Suspicious over our intentions as we continue to increase the size and sophistication of La Royale, the British Government seeks certainty over their future as sole master of the seas and oceans. In reaction they have made it quite clear that any future reconciliation between our two nations will require guarantees by us that we will not extend the size of our Navy any further, and that we will place limits upon ship-building. Naturally our Government is quite outraged at these demands, however the British have made it clear that if these guarantees are not received that they will find it necessary to take the matter into their own hands. What exactly this entails is left deliberately ambiguous."
ukf.152.d:0 "In an act of what can only be described as pure insanity; the French delegation in London has flatly rejected our proposals for Naval Disarmament talks between our two nations as a means of defusing any potential crisis in the future. Apparently enraged at the idea of limiting the size of their Navy, which they regard as of paramount importance to the security of their nation, they have made it clear that they will continue to increase its sophistication and size in the coming years regardless of our objections."
ukf.153.d:0 "After several days of tense negotiation between our Foreign Minister and his French counter-part, a deal was struck this morning between our two nations regarding the future size and composition of the French Navy. Coined the Caen Agreement, France will have limits placed upon their ability to produce capital-class vessels and submarines in their navy, forcing them to focus production on smaller escort vessels and modernising their existing capital class vessels. While many believed that the agreement would initially be rejected it has become apparent that the French Government is intensely worried about the current developments in Europe, and that they believed that limiting the French Navy was a necessary sacrifice for ensuring our support in several important matters on the Continent and abroad."

ukf.2000.d:0 "Initially signed in 1928 between the British Empire, Portugal and the Hellenic Republic, the London Naval Treaty was intended to limit further naval races between nations similar to the disastrous competition between the Royal Navy and Kaisermarine that took place prior to the Great War. While criticised by many foreign powers as simply acting as a vehicle for our nation to impose maritime superiority over others, the LNT has been useful in safe-guarding crucial trade routes around the globe.\n\nToday is an auspicious occasion, our Government has been preparing a Naval Conference to be held in London over the past several months in which our partners from Portugal and Greece will attend. This Conference is intended to not only be a chance to reinvigorate the LNT, but also to lay the ground-work for future expansion. Importantly, we will begin cooperating closely with the navies of these new signatories, granting some significant advantages to our navy and nation. This will surely only increase the more nations we can 'convince' to sign the pact. In the interest of peace, of course."
ukf.2001.d:0 "While the London Naval Treaty was signed between our nation and the British Empire in 1928, it was recently made invalid, as the official agreement was only intended to last eight years. As such the British Goverment has orchestrated a new London Naval Conference and invited our nation to attend.\n\nWhile some in our Government are critical of the LNT and its effects on our ship-building capabilities, the treaty comes with certain assurances from the British Empire that we may find useful in these unstable times."
ukf.2003.d:0 "The Greek representatives at the London Naval Conference have agreed to renew the Naval Treaty between our two nations indefinitely. It seems that their concern for their security in the face of threats on the European continent out-weighs the fear of their navy being severely limited."
ukf.2004.d:0 "The Portuguese representatives at the London Naval Conference have agreed to renew the Naval Treaty between our two nations indefinitely. It seems that their concern for their security in the face of threats on the European continent out-weighs the fear of their navy being severely limited."
ukf.2010.d:0 "Now that the London Naval Treaty has one again been renewed between ourselves and other nations, the time has come to invite additional members to the treaty. Europe is perhaps the most unstable continent in the world at this moment, and several nations are fearful of war breaking out between them and their neighbours. As such as should approach these nations in an attempt to capitalise on their fear and force them to join the LNT. Of course, the better our relations with these nations are, the more likely they are to accept."
ukf.2011.d:0 "With the London Naval Conference held only recently, the British Government has approached our nation with an offer to officially join the London Naval Treaty. Accepting this agreement will severely hamper our ability to develop new vessels for our navy, but it will also place our nation under British protection, ensuring their assistance in any defensive war we may have to fight in the future."
ukf.2020.d:0 "With new members joining the LNT regularly, the time has come for us to extend our gaze to Asia. While there are few nations there that could join the LNT, ensuring their accession will place us in a firm position of power in the region in the future."
ukf.2100.d:0 "The London Naval Treaty has expanded to encompass a great number of nations across the world, and in turn our influence has grown with it. The time has come to extend this treaty to one of our great European rivals, the Germans. We recognise that the greatest threat to our hegemony is the expansion of the French influence across the globe, and so we must work with the Germans to put the French back in their place. However, this does not mean that we and the Germans are friends – merely allies by circumstance. We cannot allow the Germans to take this time to attempt to challenge us and our navy, we must impose a naval treaty on them and prevent them from expanding their navy and in turn we shall assist them against the French menace."
ukf.2101.d:0 "This morning the British Government approached our nation with a proposal with smoothing over the poor relations between our nations as well as setting out clear boundaries between us over the future of our two countries.\n\nThe British have therefore proposed that we enter into a naval agreement with their nation, named the Jutland Pact. This agreement will severely hamper our efforts to produce a navy, but in return the British will refrain from meddling in our affairs elsewhere and will given security guarantees to our nation.\n\nMany without our Government have outright rejected such a proposal, but if we are to reclaim our last territories British backing would surely help."
ukf.2201.d:0 "This morning the British representative in our capital approached our Government with a proposal from Westminster. Despite relations being frayed in recent years due to tensions between our two empires, the British have made an attempt to smooth over this poor state of affairs, though their proposal has left many within our Government speechless over its audacity.\n\nApparently viewing the naval build-up between our two nations as a chief concern, the British have proposed that we sign a naval accord with their nation, named the Dover Pact. Such an agreement would severely hamper our efforts to produce naval vessels in the future, but would result in security guarantees from the British. Given the volatile state of affairs both in Europe and overseas, some in our Government believe that the agreement may be prudent to sign, at least for now."


ukf.2250.d:0 "This morning the Foreign Office was notified of a recent departure from the London Naval Treaty. While the cause for their departure is still unknown, many suspect it is due to the poor relations with their nation and unwillingness to be part of a diplomatic agreement with a nation they regard poorly."

ukf.2500.d:0 "As new members flock to the LNT the effects of their membership begins to be felt in the Royal Navy and throughout the Empire. close cooperation with our friends will only boost our capability to produce, maintain, and innovate in the naval arena. What's more, the more nations we can convince to sign the treaty, the stronger these effects will become."

ukf.315.d:0 "Our influence in Tibet has been fairly weak, but in the past it reached a point to where we drew the McMahon Line and formalised the borders of the Raj. However, as the Chinese and Japanese continue to expand and challenge our influence in Asia, it is important that we secure the borders of the Raj and in order to properly do this, we must secure our influence in Tibet."
ukf.316.d:0 "The British have delivered us an ultimatum, they demand we become an official protectorate under their administration. The alternative would be waging war against them in order to protect our sovereignty, though doing such a thing may be suicidal. Additionally, becoming a British protectorate may protect us against the praying eyes of the Chinese."
ukf.317.d:0 "The Tibetans have agreed to our demands and have become an official protectorate of ours! Our influence continues to grow unopposed!"

ukf.350.d:0 "While the Siamese were an ally of our nation during the Great War, in recent years they have grown cold towards our attempts at improving relations between our two nations, instead they have attempted to carve our their total independence from our influence. This is unacceptable.\n\nIf we are to solidify our position as Master of the Asian continent, then we must bring the Siamese into the fold, by force or otherwise. Demanding they become a protectorate is unlikely to be accepted, but we may also demand a Kra Isthmus from their nation, a strip of land that can connect our Burmese and Malaysian possessions together. Securing this land may sour relations betwene our nations, but it will firmly place them within our sphere of influence."
ukf.351.d:0 "The British representative in Bangkok has today issued a note to our Government. They have stated that due to the increasing instability both in Asia, and across the world, that it would be in the best interests of our nation to become a protectorate of the British Empire, to 'ensure stability in Asia'. Such a proposal is ridiculous and will make our nation nothing but a puppet of the Empire, but given the rising chance of war in Asia perhaps it is not so mad after-all."
ukf.352.d:0 "It seems that the Siamese government is more intelligent than previously thought, rather than fight a war with the Empire they have decided to acquiesce to our demands by becoming a protectorate."
ukf.353.d:0 "Unsurprisingly the Siamese government has flat-out refused our generous proposal to become a protectorate of the Empire. It seems that in order to impose our will upon this region we will need to do so with a direct application of force."
ukf.354.d:0 "British amibitions in Asia are something that our nation has known much of over the years, but today they have set a new record for how far they are willing to go to ensure their own mastery of Asia. Today the British representative has demanded the Kra Isthmus from our nation, a small strip of land that would link the British Burmese and Malaysian colonies together directly. While many of our people are rightfully out-raged at this proposal, some within our Government have suggested that it is but a small price to pay for keeping ourselves out of the cross-hairs of the British Empire."
ukf.355.d:0 "The Siamese representative in London today has signed a new treaty between our nations that will see them cede the Kra Isthmus to our control. With our Burmese and Malaysian colonies linked direclty over land, our control over the region has strengthened significantly."
ukf.356.d:0 "This morning at the Siamese embassy in London, our Foreign Minister concluded a meeting with the Siamese ambassador where he received a stern rejection of our demand to cede the Kra Isthmus to our control. It would seem that only through force can we hope to impose our will upon the Siamese nation."

ukf.401.d:0 "Since its glorious capture in 1895 by our armed forces, Taiwan has been a useful naval base and staging area for the IJN. Today the British Government has approached our government with an offer to purchase the island from us, so that the Royal Navy can secure trade in the area. Despite our assurances that we can handle that matter ourselves, the British Government has pushed the matter significantly, and it seems that if we refuse it may make our relations deteriorate dramatically."

One of these topics is the issue of the Imperial Economic Policy and it would appear that the policy of the Empire in the future has been chosen, and as expected we are receiving the benefits of said policy and will continue to so long as we remain loyal to the British."
emp.2.d:0 "The most pressing issue at this year’s Imperial Conference is Britain’s own policy regarding the Empire and the status of the Dominions and Colonies. As expected, the mother country has decided to pursue the Status Quo and preserve the Empire in its current state, despite the many protests and demands from many Dominion representatives – namely the Canadian representative – for increased autonomy in line with their sacrifices in the name of Empire."
emp.3.d:0 "In a shocking display of treachery, our once loyal dominion of Canada has rejected our continuation of the Status Quo within the Empire! They are demanding that we either give into their requests for self-determination or offer some other form of compensation to keep them as our dominion. We knew that continuing this policy wouldn’t please many of the dominions, but we never expected such blatant treason as this!"
emp.4.d:0 "In response to our refusal of the Status Quo, Britain has approached us with an interesting and unexpected offer. They offer us full control over the Newfoundland Dominion in exchange for us rescinding our previous statements regarding the Status Quo and remaining apart of the Empire as a whole. Accepting this offer would certainly please many in our country, but it would also be turning our backs on our fellow dominions who we have fought tirelessly for to provide them the autonomy they deserve!"
emp.5.d:0 "The British have responded to our refutation of the Status Quo policy, and have informed us that they will never back down to a ‘treacherous colony.’ It is clear that the British care only for their own interests then the interests of their Empire, we can only hope that our actions inspire in the other dominions with the hope and courage to stand up to the British and their oppression!"
emp.6.d:0 "Just as we had hoped, the Canadians could not refuse our deal exchanging Newfoundland for their loyalty. The territory is now officially Canadian and they have agreed to remain a part of the Empire and stay loyal to the crown. The Empire is whole again."
emp.7.d:0 "To our great dismay, the Canadians have rejected our gracious offer of unification between them and Newfoundland. It would seem then for now that we are at an impasse, with the Canadians sure to bring up the issue again if we refuse to grant additional autonomy to the Dominions and attempt to maintain the status quo."
emp.9.d:0 "Reports from the colonial administration in India have indicated that once more Indian rebels are marching on Delhi in an attempt to oust our administrators and remove our influence from the sub-continent entirely.\n\nApparently spurred on by our refusal to give India increased autonomy, these rebels are likely to receive significant foreign support from nations hostile to our presence in the region."
emp.10.d:0 "The most important issue being raised in this year’s Imperial Conference is the issue of the status of the Dominions and colonies within the Empire. Britain has shocked many around the world, by announcing their plans for further decentralisation and increasing the autonomy of her various dominions worldwide. The motherland is finally giving us our recognition for our sacrifices in the Great War."
emp.11.d:0 "As India is once more caught in the grasp of a country-wide rebellion against British forces, we have been given the opportunity to assist the Indians in their fight against British oppression. By sending them arms and supplies it will be unlikely for us to directly turn the tide, but at the very least it will bog the British down in India further."
emp.12.d:0 "Assistance in the form of arms and supplies have arrived this morning from a foreign backer in support of our cause."
emp.15.d:0 "The most important issue being raised in this year’s Imperial Conference is the issue of the status of the Dominions and the Empire. This time, the British have proposed a truly enormous change in policy. An Imperial Federation, consisting of an Imperial Parliament with elected representatives from every Dominion, and in which each Dominion has control over their internal affairs while the Federation and Imperial Parliament decide foreign policy and external affairs for the Empire as a single entity. This is the grandest plan the British have ever proposed for the Empire, and many Dominion parliaments have already expressed outrage at the project."
emp.16.d:0 "A representative has delivered us their response to our proposal for an Imperial Federation. This is a truly ambitious project of ours, and so it is imperative we seek approval from our dominions in order to continue. Should a Dominion decline our proposal, we will have opportunities in the coming years to negotiate with their Parliament in an attempt to coerce them into agreement."
emp.21.d:0 "The Imperial Federation is a truly vast project, and as such requires vast renovations to every nation involved. Additionally, the political changes to our nation are bound to be great and so we must construct a new Imperial Parliament in the nation to house our Imperial representatives."
emp.22.d:0 "The Imperial Federation that we intend to pursue will not be an easy undertaking, we must manoeuvre carefully in order to keep the Dominions on our side when building the groundwork for such a Federation. It is therefore imperative we decide on the workings of the overarching Imperial Parliament and how best to properly represent the Empire.\n\nDominion acceptance of the proposed Federation is likely to depend significantly on our choice in this matter, with the First-past-the-post system being seen as unfavourably benefitting the UK at the expense of the rest of the Federation."
emp.23.d:0 "The Imperial Economy is a juggernaut on the world stage, taking top spot as the Workshop of the World the handling of it is not only an issue for our own Empire but an issue for the world as a whole. We must decide therefore, how best to conclude the Imperial Economic Policies within the Federation. We can either dictate the policy directly from London, or allow our Dominions a say in the Imperial Economy."
emp.24.d:0 "It is well known that whoever controls the military does in fact control the nation. Consequently, the topic of deciding who the Imperial High Command shall consist of has been of hot debate since we first proposed the Federation. Many of our dominions are demanding we provide them seats for representation within the High Command, however, our own generals argue that doing such a thing would only divide the High Command between different doctrinal thoughts and result in disorganisation in the event of another global conflict."
emp.25.d:0 "Our plans for the Imperial Federation are coming along splendidly! The main bulk of the preparations are finished or are underway, all that remains is to integrate the Dominions into the Federation – though the work does not stop there!"
emp.26.d:0 "The workings of the Imperial Economy will be vast and complex, each corner of this vast Federation will require different levels of funding for different things. We have therefore been approached by a group of economists within our country with a proposal to establish a central Imperial Bank. This would allow the Imperial Economy to run smoothly with each Dominion requesting the necessary funds for certain projects from this bank with any proposals needing approval from the Imperial Parliament. This would allow us to keep on top of any enormous expenses by our Dominions, and secure the economy in order to prevent another London Stock Market Crash style event."
emp.27.d:0 "The political situation inside the Federation is likely to be a complex web or parties, ideologies and policies. As of this day many Dominions in our Empire share vastly different political landscapes, and if this continues into the Federation it is sure to cause great conflict within the Imperial Parliament. To that end, an idea to establish a Unified Party System has been created in which we will establish branches of the main British political parties within each Dominion to create the kind of coherence and stability that this Federation will need."
emp.28.d:0 "Our Empire covers a huge amount of the Earth’s surface and contains a vast amount of resources within it, however, this does not mean that the resources within the Empire are the cheapest or offer the most attractive deals to other members in the Empire and as such we are losing vast amounts of income to foreign nations as a result. Consequently, we must establish a policy of Imperial Preference when it comes to trade in which the prices of goods from other dominions is much more attractive to other dominions then foreign goods thanks to a series of heavy tariffs."
emp.29.d:0 "By deciding to allow Dominion representatives onto our Military High Command, it is paramount that we ensure cohesion and proper organisation of the military – particularly if we face another global conflict akin to the Great War. We must therefore setup a system of Imperial Military Conferences to be called during wartime to formalise battle plans and military tactics if the situation arises."
emp.30.d:0 "The preparations are complete, the groundwork is finished and we are ready to begin the transition into The Imperial Federation. What was once a ridiculous dream of the most ambitious imperialist, will soon be reality. This is truly a momentous occasion for Britain and her Empire – but the work is not over yet. All that remains is notifying the Dominions that now is the time for their final decision on the matter."
emp.40.d:0 "Canada is a massive landmass with bountiful natural resources, with the resources of the British Empire firmly behind it we could turn Canada into a real industrial powerhouse, the only question is how?\n\nIf we spend resources to open new factories we could ensure that Canadian production becomes the envy of the world, and with all that empty land there is plenty of space to open new factories particularly in regions where there is higher unemployment.\n\nHowever, there is also massive deposits of oil in the western parries so much that it could rival the oil reserves of the middle east if tended to properly, perhaps it would be best to send some British trained explorers and miners out West to aid in harnessing this resource.\n\nThen again, Eastern Canada is the hub of the country and is unfortunately heavily separated from the west by vast plains that makes movement west nearly impossible for both administration and military, perhaps by investing in the TransCanada railway we could bring the East and West coasts closer together."
emp.41.d:0 "While South Africa has never been the most peaceful or stable of imperial dominions it does have a strategic value as well as a great notary one. In 1838 Diamonds were found near the Orange River and with that discovery South Africa became a much more important region. But how should we go about ensuring we get hold of these precious stones?\n\nSome say the most effective way to obtain these diamonds would not be dig for them ourselves but instead to ensure that there are proper facilities in place to process them once they are found. These new factories would also be a show of good faith to the people that the King does care about their well being.\n\nAnother option is the obvious one, we just start digging. We know roughly where the diamonds were found and if we expand British mining corporations in the region we are certain to find something beneath the earth. Even if its not the gems we want there are plenty of heavy metals that could be turned to much more practical purposes.\n\nThe final and least direct option is to focus on the infrastructure of the region. While certainly not as directly lucrative as building factories or digging for gems it will connect the Governor General to the entirety of his population and perhaps even pull some of the natives and Boers towards the coast, allowing them to properly join society."
emp.42.d:0 "While the Oceanic Dominions were for a time poorer than the other parts of the Empire they have in recent decades become extremely wealthy in no small part due to continued investment and immigration from the Home Isles. However, there is still more yet that can be done and experts have determined three manners in which we could do this.\n\nSeveral members of government have argued that the only effective way to increase the quality of life in Oceania would be to invest in and expand their agricultural sector. Many Australians and New Zealanders have taken to ranching and shepherding to make a living, if we pour money into these sectors they could increase production thus employing more of the population.\n\nOthers argue that there must be some natural resources to be found beneath the Oceanic earth. While it may take some time to find it if we do it will open up an entirely new form of business for the Australasians and who knows maybe they will find something really useful down there.\n\nThe last option would be to create job projects by finishing the Canberra to Perth Railway and the Island Rail networks. If we ensure we hire only local labour and oversight the people of Australia and New Zealand will be incredibly happy with our assistance and even more so will be able to transport both people and resources across the outback and through the mountains."
emp.43.d:0 "The Raj is and always has been a fantastic commercial tool for the British Empire, sending out silks, cotton, dyes, gems, tea and spices to the far reaches of the Empire to then be sold abroad. However, while building up the luxury resources we have left practicality fall to the wayside, parliament has give us funds to correct this, but what should we turn to?\n\nWe could attempt to create more factories in loyal regions of India this would help with unemployment and could cause a spike in more practical industries which they could then use to fund their own expansion going forward.\n\nAnother option would be to invest heavily into the resources of the region. With such a huge land base there is no way we will not find heavy metals or other more practical resources below the surface. All we would need to do is send in a few prospecting teams.\n\nOr we could try to complete the Indian Railway, this would ensure easier travel across the region which would give people the mobility they need in order to go and find jobs and be productive imperial citizens."
emp.50.d:0 "After years of political turmoil and inter-Imperial diplomacy, Westminster has today demanded our official, and final, response to the question of the Imperial Federation."
emp.51a.d:0 "Canada has responded to our request for a final decision regarding participation in the Imperial Federation. They have agreed to become part of the Federation for the foreseeable future."
emp.51b.d:0 "Canada has responded to our request for a final decision regarding participation in the Imperial Federation. Foolishly they have rejected to become part of the Federation, our choices for a response are limited and must be considered carefully."

emp.100.d:0 "Several days have passed since the Dominion parliaments were officially dissolved and their representatives took their place at the Imperial Parliament in London. Only several years ago our Empire was divided, fractured and on the cusp of disintegration. The actions of a few brave men who sought to bring power and stability back to the Empire have ensured that we are once again a power to be reckoned with.\n\nWith instability at an end, and the people's of the Empire once more united towards a common goal, we stand together to face whatever challenges history will throw our way. Though the path ahead will be challenging and full of risk, we can take solace in the fact that we will face it not as a divided Empire, but as one nation with but one goal. Our flag will be raised across the globe, we will defend liberty wherever we can and we will ensure peace on this green Earth. We will not forget the age-old wisdom: 'United we stand, divided we fall'"
emp.500.d:0 "Since our announcement to pursue an Imperial Federation the Empire has seemed more volatile than ever before. While some of the Dominion Governments may have expressed interest in this Imperial Federation, several ethnic groups within the Empire have become outraged at the possibility. Most angry of all are the Boers.\n\nSince the end of the Third Boer War during the Great War, South Africa has lived in relative peace and harmony and while the fighting was brutal, many believed a certain degree of reconciliation was taking place in the country. To suggest so today however, one would only be met with derision.\n\nThe Boers - for the fourth time in less than sixty years - have risen the standard of rebellion against the Empire. Unwilling to allow their autonomy be taken from them in the Empire's attempts at federalisation, the Boers have already succeeded in raiding many arms depots throughout South Africa and have captured a large swathe of territory in their wake. More worringly, some military units of South Africa have defected to the Boer side. It seems that this Boer War may be bloodier than any before it."
emp.501.d:0 "While we are tied down in South Africa dealing with the Boers once more, it seems several prominent Indian nationalist politicians have seized the opportunity to declare total independence from the Empire. Stating that they could not remain inside an Empire that refuses to grant them greater autonomy, they were forced to take action to defend their nation. While the revolt of '35 was relatively spontaneous, today's revolt seems to be a coordinated affair with politicians and militia leaders acting together, as such only Burma and Ceylon remain under our control with the rest of our loyal forces either ousted from mainland India, or placed under temporary arrest by the new Indian administration.\n\nDespite this set-back plans are already in motion for returning to India to re-assert our rule. Several of the Indian Princes remain and some have indicated that they would support a return of British rule to the sub-continent in an effort to stabilise the region. Furthermore, while the Indian mainland is today united under a single banner, Royal Intelligence believes that this will not last long, with several smaller factions already ready to attempt a breakaway from the new Indian nation."
emp.502.d:0 "With our victory in ejecting the British out of South Africa and securing control over large swathes of the former Union of South Africa, we today have the opportunity to attempt to demand peace with the British."
emp.503.d:0 "With our military having been ejected from several territories formerly belonging to the Union of South Africa, the rebellious Boers have seen fit to sue for peace with our nation. They demand that we hand over control of South African territories to their control and withdraw all Imperial troops from the region. How should we respond?"
emp.504.d:0 "The British Government has foolishly rejected our demands for peace."
emp.511.d:0 "With the British Empire once more occupied with another Boer War, many within our Government believe that by sending arms and supplies to the Boers that we may boost their chances of finally driving the British from South Africa."
emp.512.d:0 "French Arms and Supplies have arrived this morning to assist us in our battle against the British."
emp.513.d:0 "German Arms and Supplies have arrived this morning to assist us in our battle against the British."

ukflavour.1.d:0 "When the Bolton-Manchester Canal burst its banks at Little Lever yesterday millions of gallons of water cascaded 300 feet into the River Irwell, carrying down hundreds of tons of earth and stones. The river rapidly became blocked on the Bury side and the banked-up water flooded the surrounding land. "Like Niagara" was the description applied by one resident in the vicinity. Bricks and iron reinforcements of the side of the canal were torn away and carried into the river. Canal barges were smashed up as they too swept over the falls. Fortunately, there are no houses in the neighbourhood, and no one was hurt. It is feared that work at a paper mill and a chemical works which depend upon the canal for transport will be affected."
ukflavour.2.d:0 "Famous female aviator, Amy Johnson, has once again embarked to break the speed record for a flight from London to Cape Town. She successfully regained the record today as she touched down in Cape Town to the sound of tremendous cheer from the crowds."
ukflavour.3.d:0 "The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel written by author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published today to wide critical acclaim. It has been selling very fast and is already wildly popular due to its fantasy nature and exciting story. It is sure to be a big hit for a long time to come!"
ukflavour.4.d:0 "This morning Mr. Alan Turing published his new book 'On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.'. The book which is quickly becoming popular among those interested in the development of computing machines, details the several of 'Turing's Proofs', an attempt at elaborating on the Entscheidungsproblem, the conclusion of which that it has no solution. While critics have already begun to pour over the book, many believe it is an important step forward in our understanding of Computing Machines."
ukflavour.5.d:0 "The original Crystal Palace was the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Built in what is now Kensington Gardens, it was an astonishing prefabricated construction, created on parkland and still with many trees inside. Masterfully designed in glass, iron and wood by the architect Joseph Paxton, it wowed thousands of visitors to the exhibition from this country and all over the world and there could hardly have been a more effective demonstration of advanced British technology.\n\nLast night as a local walked his dog past the building he saw flames inside, after hurrying inside he discovered two nightwatchmen attempting to extinguish the fire. Despite their brave attempts, the Fire Brigade was called, arriving shortly after. Even then they could not successfully combat the fire, with it turning into an inferno. Several hours later hundreds of people had flocked to watch the spectacle as the blaze continued well into the morning. By the time the sun rose, it was clear that Paxton's masterpiece had been reduced to twisted metal and piles of scrap.\n\nOne of the most iconic buildings in Britain, a building opened by Queen Victoria herself, has been lost to tragedy."
ukflavour.6.d:0 "Remarkable results in colour television were demonstrated by the Baird Company at the Dominion Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, early this month. The demonstration was remarkable in sevearl ways, and it was the first of its kind ever given, through in 1928 Mr. Baird showed a picture of a few inches square in colour at the British Association meeting in Glasgow. This, however, was transmitted by wire.\n\nIn this latest development the size of the picture is 12ft. by 9ft. and the transmission by radio from the South Tower of the Crystal Palace, a wavelength of 9.3 metres being used. Another special feature of the demonstration was that the colour is exceedingly good and on the whole more pleasing to the eye than are the latest colour films. No claim was made that the definition came up to the standard of the ordinary transmissions and Mr. Baird clearly stated that this was regarded as a preliminary experiment. Even so, the demonstration was most impressive and the results comes as a surprise to those who witnessed it."
ukflavour.7.d:0 "This morning the BBC Television Service officially launched from Alexandra Palace. It will become the world's first regularly scheduled public television service, allowing us to extend British media influence to nations around the globe.\n\nTwo systems, the 405-line Marconi-EMI and the 240-line Baird intermediate film system, were trialed for a period of six months prior to today in order to determine which was best suited for continued television service, with Marconi's 405-line ultimately being chosen."
ukflavour.8.d:0 "For the past two years the John Brown and Company shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, has been hard at work designing an improved version of RMS Queen Mary, an ocean liner which only recently performed its maiden voyage in May of 1936.\n\nThe RMS Queen Elizabeth was designed to be a much improved version of her sister ship, with additional deck and cargo space, as well as increased passenger service. At midday today the Queen herself performed the launching ceremony and the ship has been sent for fitting out. It will still be some time before she conducts her maiden voyage as numerous engine tests are required, but the RMS Queen Elizabeth is once again more proof, if any more were needed, of the skills of British craftsmanship in the area of naval construction."
ukflavour.9.d:0 "Legendary British racing motorist, Mr. John Cobb, has once again set a new land speed record in Bonneville today. Driving the piston-engined, wheel-driven Railton Special he broke the Land Speed Record at a speed of 367.91mph, having beaten the previous record set by Mr. George Eyston at 357.5mph, also at Bonneville."
ukflavour.10.d:0 "Tragedy has struck today twelve miles off the coast of Great Orme, Llandudno, Wales. HMS Thetis which was performing sea trials sank unexpectingly, in what many believe to have been an accident. Preliminary investigations have indicated that the bow of the submarine was flooded by seawater, although there are no indications as of yet as to how the submarine flooded. It took several hours before the telegram raising the alarm arrived at the Royal Navy's submarine HQ in Portsmouth, and even longer before a ship could reach the area to begin rescue operations, as the nearest vessel was several hundred miles away.\n\nOnly four men have reportedly escaped the disaster, with the remainder of the vessel's crew having perished due to oxygen deprivation or in attempts to flee the vessel via the hatch previously used to escape by others. Royal Navy Submarine Headquarters has said that it will be many months before the ship can be reached, and the bodies of those dead removed for burial."
ukflavour.11.d:0 "For the past several years, the best dockyard workers from across the Empire have converged in Scapa Flow to construct HMS Trafalgar, the largest battleship ever constructed in history. While normally secretive, much fuss has been made of the construction of this vessel as HMS Trafalgar is intended to serve as a symbol of British naval dominance.\n\nNamed after our victory over the combined French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar in 1805, the date has since been used as a historical note to mark the beginning of our unmatched naval dominance.\n\nHMS Trafalgar will serve not only as a symbol of our strength, but as a reminder that our thalassocracy cannot be challenged successfully."
ukflavour.12.d:0 "As the genre of science-fiction continues to stir the imagination of the populace of both the British Empire and those around the world, a burgeoning author from the United States today concluded a small conference in Aberdeen, Scotland where he spoke at length of the prospects of science fiction in the future.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein was a former United States Navy Officer who was discharged over a decade ago after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, he has since gone on to write several short stories in the new science fiction genre. Fascinated by the form of Government within the our nation following Jack's political reforms - even speaking with several military officers within the British Armed Forces about them - he has since returned to his home in the United States following his stay in our country. Speaking of his experience in the United Kingdom, he simply stated that he found the stay interesting and informative. One wonders if it will have any affect on his work in the coming future."
ukflavour.30.d:0 "This morning as elements of the British Army converged on a German fortification - known among local military commanders simply as 'Hill 415' - perhaps the most bizarre battle of the war so far was to begin. As British soldiers approached the fortification through thick fog, a roar sounded from the German lines followed by the sounds of rushing footsteps. Quickly it became apparent that the German position had abandoned defence and opted to charge the British soldiers, using the fog for cover. What came next was unexpected for both sides.\n\nIt began with a crash and a scream as a charging German infantryman - axe in hand - planted the weapon squarely between the eyes of a startled British soldier. Recognising what was happening the British Army Officer in charge gave the order to switch to military sabres and engage the enemy in hand-to-hand. Over the course of the next hour British and German infantrymen engaged in one of the largest close combat battles since the Napoleonic era.\n\nAs the fog cleared the true horror soon became visible to all. Several hundred dead British and German soldiers, some brutally mutilated, others with the weapons that killed them still buried in their bodies lay thick across the area. The Battle of Hill 415 was over."
ukflavour.40.d:0 "Glorious news has reached the Government this morning of successful military options to capture Paris from French control. For the first time since the Hundred Years' War British troops have successfully laid siege to Paris and captured it for the glory of the British Empire.\n\nWhile fighting continues in the outskirts of the city a military parade was quickly organised by the British Commander with British troops marching underneath the Arc de Triomphe as horrified Parisians looked on. While the war with France is expected to continue the blow that has been struck to our rival today cannot be understated.\n\nAt last, our victory is within reach."
ukflavour.41.d:0 "While denied to us in the Great War, today marks a momentous day in our war against the German. The Army has successfully captured Berlin with support from the Royal Air Force.\n\nBitter fighting erupted almost immediately as our soldiers entered the city though it was not enough to delay our advance and capture of important landmarks around the city. The German Fuhrer is said to have fled the city days ago, and his whereabouts are currently unknown. Search parties have spread out from the city in an attempt to discover where he may have fled to. As the war with Germany continues it has become clear to all at home and abroad that we have the iniative in this war. The only question remains; how much longer will victory elude our grasp?"
ukflavour.42.d:0 "Rome, once the capital of perhaps the greatest Empire the world has ever seen, has fallen into our control. Brave soldiers of the British Army succeeded in storming the city in recent days, although guerilla fighting continues on the streets of the city as stubborn Italian defenders attempt to harass our soldiers.\n\nAs war with Italy continues unabated many wonder how longer the Italians will continue to fight with their capital under foreign occupation and with public support for their Government's war effort beginning to dwindle. All that is known however is that our onslaught across the Italian peninsula is likely to continue, and with the capture of Rome morale across the British Armed Forces has increased significantly."
ukflavour.43.d:0 "Constantinople, the City of the World's Desire, has been successfully captured and occupied by British soldiers. Long held by the Ottoman Empire after their conquest of the remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Conquest of Constantinople was in many ways a wake-up call for European nations and the threat that was posed by the powerful Ottoman Empire.\n\nWhile successfully occupied by Allied Forces in the Great War, the occupation was to be short-lived. Today the occupation of Constantinople will continue indefinitely, at least until the Turkish nation has been crushed by our Armed Forces."
ukflavour.44.d:0 "Reports from the North American frontlines indicate that British troops have successfully captured Washington DC from American defenders. Stubbornly defended by tens of thousands of American soldiers, the siege of Washington required every weapon in the Armed Forces to win. Beginning with a lengthy air bombardment of entrenched positions throughout the city, and accompanied by a similar bombardment from the Royal Navy, British troops moved slowly through the streets of DC before finally driving the American defenders out.\n\nCelebrations were limited as American partisans almost immediately began attacking British convoys in the region, with soldiers dying at the hands of armed civilians and soldiers in hiding. In retaliation - and in repetition of the war of 1812 - British soldiers plundered and set fire to the White House in an act of vengeance. The blaze would continue well into the night, with American citizens looking on in solemn silence.\n\nThe war with the Americans is far from over, but our victory in Washington has sent a clear message to the United State's Government; we are not to be trifled with, and our campaign will continue until we secure total victory."
ukflavour.45.d:0 "Over 150 years ago, the fateful events of the now well-known Boston Tea Party were to shake our grip in the Americas to its very core. Launched by political protestors, it is considered today to be a significant event in the American Revolution and in spurring on other rebels across the Thirteen Colonies to resist our rule in the region.\n\nThe significance of the capture of Boston is both strategic, but also symbolic. In many ways Boston was the beginning of the end of our rule over the Thirteen Colonies, with its recapture today it may mark the beginning of a renewed British rule over North America."
ukflavour.46.d:0 "The heart of Russia, and its capital city, has been captured by advancing British soldiers. Previously occupied by Napoleon's Grande Armée after retreating Russian troops set it ablaze, it has since come to harbour the Collectivists following the Russian Revolution.\n\nThe road to Moscow has been frought with struggle and suffering, many tens of thousands lie dead, with many more sure to suffer before this war ends. For now, some believe that the capture of Moscow marks the end for Russia, and the victory of Britain over them, others whisper that they fear the war will continue unabated, with the Russians largely unfazed by the occupation of one of their most important cities."
ukflavour.50.d:0 "Celebrated yearly since the death of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Empire Day has once again come to pass. Widely acknowledged throughout the Empire, this day represents the bonds that bind the Empire and those that make us family.

ukfate.1.d:0 "수세기 동안의 경쟁과 전쟁, 그리고 파괴 끝에 우리는 마침내 많은 사람들이 불가능하다고 믿어왔던 것, 즉 프랑스 본토의 완전한 점령을 달성했습니다. 영국 육군은 한때 위협적이었던 적군을 계속 정복하기 위해 프랑스 평원을 의기양양하게 행진했습니다. 프랑스의 운명은 지금 우리 손아귀에 놓여 있습니다."
ukfate.2.d:0 "오늘은 30년도 채 안 되어 멸망한 독일국에게서 거둔 역사적인 승리를 기념하는 날입니다. 이전의 전쟁도, 그리고 오늘도 승리한 영국 병사들은 브란덴부르크 문 아래를 지나 베를린 거리를 행진했습니다. 우리는 위대한 승리를 이룩했지만, 문제는 여전히 남아있습니다; 독일을 앞으로 어떻게 해야 할까요?"
ukfate.3.d:0 "이번 주 초 이탈리아 정부가 우리 정부에게 무조건 항복을 선언했기 때문에, 영국 군인들은 오늘 로마 거리에서 마지막 승전 퍼레이드를 벌였습니다. 확고하게 통제되는 이탈리아와 그 수도가 우리의 승리를 증명해주고 있습니다. 이제는 이탈리아의 미래를 결정해야 할 시간입니다."
ukfate.4.d:0 "미국 독립전쟁에서 패배한 지 거의 200년이 흘렀습니다. 그 이후로 미국은 엄청나게 강력해졌지만, 그들의 강대함도 우리의 정당한 복수를 막아설 수는 없었습니다. 충격받은 미국인들이 공포에 질려 바라보는 가운데, 영국군은 미국 주요 도시들의 거리를 행진하고 있습니다.\n\n오늘은 우리 제국 역사에 있어 새로운 전성기입니다. 우리는 전쟁에서 이겼고, 이제는 평화를 쟁취해낼 것입니다."

uk.3000.d:0 "대전쟁 당시 우리 동맹국이었던 이탈리아가 우리로부터 몰타를 사들이겠다고 나섰습니다. 몰타는 1814년부터 영국의 영토였으며, 지중해의 주요 해군기지로서 잘 기능해 왔습니다. 원래대로라면 몰타를 팔아달라는 요청 따위는 즉각 무시되었겠지만, 런던 시장 붕괴라는 재앙에 사로잡힌 지금의 상황에서는 이탈리아의 제안을 받아들이고 그 수입을 다른 곳에 투자하는 것이 우리 위대한 조국에 이득이 될 수 있습니다."

#####0.2 EVENTS#####
ukadm.1.d:0 "For five years the Right Honourable Bolton Eyres-Monsell has served as the first Lord of the Admiralty in our Government, though he has for the past few months signalled to the Government that he wishes to resign his post citing ill health, only participating in the backbenches of Parliament where necessary.\n\nIt therefore falls to us to determine who shall replace the Viscount as First Lord of the Admiralty, and there are several choices we can make.\n\nThe first proposal is to bring Sir Winston Churchill once more back into Government. Despite his failure at the Dardanelles during the Great War - the failure of which led to the cancellation of his brainchild, the proposed Gallipoli Campaign - Churchill has managed to stay afloat politically, but only barely, using his influence with several high-ranking members of the Royal Navy to maintain his relevance.\n\nSecondly we have Leo Amery, previous First Lord of the Admiralty in the 1920's, and seen as a reliable candidate to replace the Viscount, Amery has however seen scrutiny by some MPs for his close links to the Round Table Movement and it's interest in Imperial politics. Regardless, Amery has shown himself to be capable in the post and would be a reliable choice.\n\nOur final candidate is Alfred Duff Cooper. Somewhat of a firebrand in Parliament, and highly critical of the Government's recent position of pacifism in the face of rising tension worldwide, Cooper would ensure the Royal Navy maintains its strength abroad and at home."
ukadm.2.d:0 "While British society has been relatively docile since the events of the Manchester Mill Worker's Strike, there have been grumblings in several quarters of Britain. Today we have received reports of wide-spread dissent lurking in Royal Navy ranks regarding planned cuts to their pay and overall funding. Notably such dissent is also said to be coming from some Admirals who argue that the Royal Navy will no longer be able to adequately defend our Empire if these cuts continue.\n\nThough these concerns have worried some Members of Parliament - the issue itself having been raised in the Commons only recently - it appears that for now any complaints are largely only voiced behind closed doors. Until such a time as they are voiced elsewhere this matter remains of little concern."
ukadm.3.d:0 "Taking many within our Government by surprise, a detachment of sailors stationed at Invergordon have today begun a strike against the Government over cuts made to their pay, as well as the larger austerity policies pursued by our Government in response to the effects of the LSMC.\n\nMost worrying of all is the nature of the strike itself, with many red banners being flown in and around the area, and socialist songs such as 'the Red Flag' being sung by those involved. While such an action is very unacceptable, the Government response has been relatively tame so far, as we do not wish to stir up any further dissent by approaching the issue heavy-handidly. With that in mind the Government has called for a meeting on the issue of naval cuts to fully flesh out our policy in regards to thse strikers and the larger issue of broad naval funding cuts."
ukadm.4.d:0 "Now that our Government has decided to pursue an aggressive policy against the Royal Navy strikers plans are being made to break up the strikes and force these individuals to back down. Concerns have however been raised by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty as well as several Royal Navy Admirals over the manner in which the Government intends to break up the strikes, with many warning that it will only seriously inflame the entire situation.\n\nPrivately some Admirals of the Royal Navy have also demanded that we allow them to settle the issue themselves rather than move forward with our current plans, to make amtters worse there is some internal grumblings within our own party over the issue. This coordinated push-back against our Government will make it difficult to continue with our previous efforts to crush the strike."
ukadm.5.d:0 "With our Government having deciced to move forward decisively to crush the strike by sailors of the Royal Navy, some believed it was only a matter of time before the entire situation unravelled. Therefore when the events of this morning occurred, it took few by surprise.\n\nAngered by Government attempts to disregard the issues raised over naval funding cuts, the strikers were apparently successful in convincing many more of their comrades to join their efforts, with several vessels stationed at Invergordon this morning completely devoid of any crew, as the bulk of them had joined the strikers in protesting Government policy.\n\nThe Royal Navy Captains and Admirals who had been warning of such a possibility have been proven right by time, and continue to voice concerns over our Government's approach, some of them taking to local and national newspapers to do so. There is an aura of mutiny spreading throughout the entirety of the Royal Navy, and unless it is handled soon the situation may further spiral out of control."
ukadm.6.d:0 "First Lord of the Admiralty, Alfred Duff Cooper, has met with the First Sea Lord, and the various Admirals summoned to the capital this morning to discuss on-going events at Invergordon. Cooper was chosen as First Lord of the Admiralty due to his reliability and his significant ties and influence within the Royal Navy that he built up during the inter-war years while working under the previous First Lord of the Admiralty, Bolton Eyres-Monsell. Though there are some questions raised as to where his loyalty lies as he has shown favour to the Armed Forces in the past, siding against the Government over planned spending cuts to the British Army and Royal Air Force.\n\nHaving developed the aforementioned close links with the Royal Navy, especially among high-ranking individuals within it, Cooper was chosen to represent the Government in this particular issue due to the latent hostility between the Royal Navy Officer Corps and the Government over its continued polciies towards slashing naval funding.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not a deal can be made to end the unrest in the Royal Navy, though this is perhaps our best option."
ukadm.7.d:0 "When the meeting between Cooper and the Royal Navy Admirals concluded many were breathing a sigh of relief, as it had appeared that a deal had been concluded between the two. What many did not expect was that the Admirals would - rather than relent on their position - double down on it, demanding openly in a signed letter to national newspapers a complete reversal of the Government's position on naval cuts. To add fuel to the fire, the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty has also for the first time sided publically with the Royal Navy rather than continue his previous approach of discussing these concerns with the Government discreetly.\n\nMany within our Government are in a fury over Cooper's obvious duplicity in this matter, but many more are beginning to change their positions on this concern, obviously sensing a change in the direction of where this situation is heading.\n\nSince this unrest began many of the public have been slowly coming around to the strikers position, and what is now regarded as the Royal Navy position, on the entire issue. Government popularity continues to plummet quite fantastically, and this show of opposition both without and within our Party, has only created a political crisis within our Government. We must act swiftly if we are to rectify this issue, if necessary ensuring that Cooper is removed from his position entirely."
ukadm.8.d:0 "With the inability of our Government to come up with a concrete plan to tackle the current crisis, Westminster has been paralyzed by inaction, and rebellious Members of Parliament have begun to push for fresh leadership elections to enact a 'change of policy' towards the Royal Navy.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events a relatively young and unknown MP has taken the lead in opposing the Government over this issue, one Anthony Eden. Young and inexperienced, though hostile to proposed plans to curb the extent of the British Armed Forces, Eden has managed to not only bring around many within our own party to his point of view but has also succeeded in drawing great attention among the public sphere to this scandal by interviews in national newspapers, having become something of a notable public figure in the process. It is curious how he managed to propel himself to such an extent so rapidly, many suspect that those Admirals who oppose the Government have thrown their lot in with Eden as a means of boosting his influence within our Party in an effort to push through their agenda. With this backing Eden has succeeded in forcing the Government to push through for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.\n\nIt would seem we are left with little choice on what to do next."
ukadm.9.d:0 "As the sun fell on the Houses of Parliament last night, many MPs were uncharacteristically still present until the small hours of the morning in an effort to settle the issue of leadership within our party once and for all.\n\nFailing to receive the votes necessary in a closer-door vote of no-confidence, Sir Samuel Hoare was forced to acquiesce to fresh leadership elections within our party.\n\nUnsurprisingly the influential Anthony Eden had deftly navigated the situation to position himself as a front-runner in this new contest, having used his support from the Admirals, First Sea Lord, and the Royal Navy to further bolster his position. Curiously many of his policies proposed seem to differ somewhere on his previously stated political position on many subjects, leading some to wonder what precisely was agreed with those Admirals who had opposed Government policy in his meeting with them just a few weeks ago.\n\nRegardless, as dawn begins to set over London a busy night has been concluded, and few people expected any other result than what was made clear last night."
ukadm.10.d:0 "Several weeks have passed since the now Prime Minister Eden took his place as leader of the Conservative Party and of the British nation itself, and it would seem that the agreement made with him has been quickly implemented, with him pursuing the policies that were agreed upon. To show our intention to honour our agreement fully, we met with the Prime Minister at Westminster at Midnight last night to further determine what our policies should be for the foreseeable future, in resolute agreement with our determination to strengthen the Royal Navy and Britain's place on the Seven Seas, the Prime Minister has laid out his own grand plans for the creation of several extremely powerful and commanding naval vessels in the near future. Due to the effects the Mutiny at Invergordon had on the Government, we have found ourselves with significant influence in both the Conservative Party and Civil Service. This will no doubt ensure that Eden remains in his position for the forseeable future, allowing him to continue pushing forward and supporting the policies that were agreed upon those weeks ago.\n\nTo conclude last night's meeting, a vow was declared between those in Government and those in the Royal Navy; that never again will politicians be allowed to threaten the safety and security of the British people once more. The Royal Navy must remain a sacred institution, untouched by the petty politics of the day. In order to ensure this we must continue to exert our influence where necessary."
ukadm.11.d:0 "With our Government's choice to attempt to negotiate with the Royal Navy strikers, a series of negotiations have been organised to help overcome this crisis.\n\nSo far the demands have been what we expected, a return to previous pay for the sailors of the Royal Navy for a period of no less than 12 months, with future negotiations to decide whether or not this pay should continue - as it will depend on further economic developments -, many within our Government believe that even these demands are going a step too far, as one must understand the Royal Navy's history of mutiny.\n\nIn a historical perspective, this is one of only a few occassions that the Royal Navy has ever begun a mutiny of sorts against the Government, many are fearful that by allowing ourselves to be intimidated by these strikers it will only invite further revolt across the Armed Forces and Royal Navy.\n\nRegardless of the historical context, it comes to us today to decide the fate of these negotiations."
ukadm.12.d:0 "With the efforts of our Government in ending the strike successful, those would-be mutineers have returned to duty and the public have lost interest in the entire affair as other more important issues have begun to permiate national news.\n\nThis affair has served as a reminder to all those within the Armed Forces that the Government does not back down over issues as severe as these."
ukadm.15.d:0 "Now that our influence over the Government in Westminster is secure we have begun rectifying many of the past mistakes of successive Governments of the Empire. While this occurs, there have been some concerns raised over protecting our hold over the Government in the long term. Proposals have therefore been put forward to reshuffle sections of the Government and the Conservative Party when possible to install individuals who are more sympathetic to our cause, specifically those who formerly served in the Royal Navy, and will likely see eye-to-eye with many of our policies.\n\nSuch an action will undoubtedly cost a certain amount of political capital, but will strengthen our Government's position in the long run."
ukadm.16.d:0 "With the Royal Navy's influence growing daily within the halls of Westminster, many within the partnership have begun to believe that the time has arrived to curb the influence of the British Army and RAF as well. This would undoubtedly strengthen the position of the Navy further, though it may have ramifications at a later date that are less than ideal."
ukadm.17.d:0 "While at the time it seemed absurd that by giving priority to the Royal Navy we would weaken our military as a whole, it would appear that our previous choice to support the RN above the other institutions of the Armed Forces has had a negative effect after-all."
ukadm.18.d:0 "After five long years since the previous election - where it would appear that the entire world has been flipped on its own head - our country has continued relatively unscathed in the commotion that was to occur globally. Our Government had naturally seen some havoc following the events of the Invergordon Mutiny, but with an iron will, many individuals whose loyalty lies only with Britain and the Empire saved the day and brought down those who would have destroyed the British Empire from within, and we do not forget our agreements with the new Government in Westminster.\n\nToday marks a new election period in British history, and using the expansive influence at our beck-and-call, there can be little doubt as to its outcome."
